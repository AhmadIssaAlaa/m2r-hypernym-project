Art rock is a subgenre of rock music that generally reflects a challenging or avant-garde approach to rock , or which makes use of modernist , experimental , or unconventional elements .
Art rock aspires to elevate rock from teen entertainment to an artistic statement , opting for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music .
Influences may be drawn from genres such as experimental rock , avant-garde music , classical music , and jazz .
Its music was created with the intention of listening and contemplation rather than for dancing , and is often distinguished by the use of electronic effects and easy listening textures far removed from the propulsive rhythms of early rock .
The term may sometimes be used interchangeably with `` progressive rock '' , though the latter is instead characterized in particular by its employment of classically trained instrumental technique and symphonic textures .
The genre 's greatest level of popularity was in the early 1970s through British artists .
The music , as well as the theatrical nature of performances associated with the genre , was able to appeal to artistically inclined adolescents and younger adults , especially due to its virtuosity and musical/lyrical complexity .
Art rock is most associated with a certain period of rock music , beginning in 1966–67 and ending with the arrival of punk in the mid 1970s .
After , the genre would be infused within later popular music genres of the 1970s–90s .
== Definitions == Critic John Rockwell says that art rock is one of rock 's most wide-ranging and eclectic genres with its overt sense of creative detachment , classical music pretensions , and experimental , avant-garde proclivities .
In the rock music of the 1970s , the `` art '' descriptor was generally understood to mean `` aggressively avant-garde '' or `` pretentiously progressive '' .
`` Art rock '' is often used synonymously with progressive rock .
Historically , the term has been used to describe at least two related , but distinct , types of rock music .
The first is progressive rock , while the second usage refers to groups who rejected psychedelia and the hippie counterculture in favor of a modernist , avant-garde approach defined by the Velvet Underground .
Essayist Ellen Willis compared these two types : From the early sixties … there was a counter-tradition in rock and roll that had much more in common with high art—in particular avant-garde art—than the ballyhooed art-rock synthesis [ progressive rock ] ; it involved more or less consciously using the basic formal canons of rock and roll as material ( much as pop artists used mass art in general ) and refining , elaborating , playing off that material to produce … rockand-roll art .
While art rock was implicitly based on the claim that rock and roll was or could be as worthy as more established art forms , rock-and-roll art came out of an obsessive commitment to the language of rock and roll and an equally obsessive disdain for those who rejected that language or wanted it watered down , made easier … the new wave has inherited the counter-tradition .
Art rock emphasizes Romantic and autonomous traditions , in distinction to the aesthetic of the everyday and the disposable embodied by art pop .
Larry Starr and Christopher Waterman 's American Popular Music defines art rock as a `` form of rock music that blended elements of rock and European classical music '' , citing the English rock bands King Crimson , Emerson , Lake & Palmer , and Pink Floyd as examples .
Common characteristics include album-oriented music divided into compositions rather than songs , with usually complicated and long instrumental sections , symphonic orchestration .
Its music was traditionally used within the context of concept records , and its lyrical themes tended to be `` imaginative '' and politically oriented .
Differences have been identified between art rock and progressive rock , with art rock emphasizing avant-garde or experimental influences and `` novel sonic structure '' , while progressive rock has been characterized as putting a greater emphasis on classically trained instrumental technique , literary content , and symphonic features .
Compared to progressive rock , art rock is `` more challenging , noisy and unconventional '' and `` less classically influenced '' , with more of an emphasis on avant-garde music .
Similarities are that they both describe a mostly British attempt to elevate rock music to new levels of artistic credibility , and became the instrumental analog to concept albums and rock operas , which were typically more vocal oriented .
Art rock can also to refer to either classically driven rock , or a progressive rock-folk fusion .
Bruce Eder 's essay The Early History of Art-Rock/Prog Rock states that `` 'progressive rock , ' also sometimes known as 'art rock , ' or 'classical rock ' '' is music in which the `` bands [ are ] playing suites , not songs ; borrowing riffs from Bach , Beethoven , and Wagner instead of Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley ; and using language closer to William Blake or T. S. Eliot than to Carl Perkins or Willie Dixon .
`` == History == === 1960s === ==== Background ==== The boundaries between art and pop music became increasingly blurred throughout the second half of the 20th century .
The first usage of the term `` art rock '' , according to Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary , was in 1968 .
As pop music 's dominant format transitioned from singles to albums , many rock bands created works that aspired to make grand artistic statements , where art rock would flourish .
As it progressed in the late 1960s – in tandem with the development of progressive rock – art rock acquired notoriety alongside experimental rock .
==== Proponents ==== The earliest figure of art rock has been assumed to be record producer and songwriter Phil Spector , who became known as an auteur for his Wall of Sound productions that aspired to a `` classical grandiosity '' .
According to biographer Richard Williams : `` [ Spector ] created a new concept : the producer as overall director of the creative process , from beginning to end .
He took control of everything , he picked the artists , wrote or chose the material , supervised the arrangements , told the singers how to phrase , masterminded all phases of the recording process with the most painful attention to detail , and released the result on his own label .
`` Williams also says that Spector transformed rock music as a performing art into an art that could only exist in the recording studio , which `` paved the way for art rock '' .
The Beach Boys ' leader Brian Wilson is also cited as one of the first examples of the auteur music producer .
Like Spector , Wilson was known as an eremitic studio obsessive who laboriously produced fantastical soundscapes through his mastery of recording technology .
Biographer Peter Ames Carlin wrote that Wilson was the forerunner of `` a new kind of art-rock that would combine the transcendent possibilities of art with the mainstream accessibility of pop music '' .
Drawing from the influence of Wilson 's work and the work of the Beatles ' producer George Martin , music producers after the mid 1960s began to view the recording studio as a musical instrument used to aid the process of composition .
Critic Stephen Holden says that mid-1960s recordings by the Beatles , Spector and Wilson are often identified as marking the start of art pop , which preceded the `` bombastic , classically inflected '' art rock that started in the late 1960s .
Many of the top British groups during the 1960s – including members of the Beatles , the Rolling Stones , the Kinks , the Who , the Move , the Yardbirds and Pink Floyd – came to music via art school .
This institution differed from its US counterpart in terms of having a less industry-applicable syllabus and in its focus on furthering eccentric talent .
By the mid-1960s , several of these acts espoused an approach based on art and originality , where previously they had been absorbed solely in authentic interpretation of US-derived musical styles , such as rock 'n ' roll and R & B .
According to journalist Richard Goldstein , many popular musicians from California ( like Wilson ) desired to be acknowledged as artists , and struggled with this aspiration .
Goldstein explains that the line between violating musical conventions and making `` truly popular music '' caused those who did n't have `` strong enough egos '' ( in contrast to Bob Dylan and the Beatles ) to be `` doomed to a respectful rejection , and a few albums with disappointing sales usually meant silence .
...
They yearned for fame , as only needy people can , but they also wanted to make art , and when both of those impulses couldn’t be achieved they recoiled in a ball of frantic confusion .
`` Author Matthew Bannister traces `` the more self-conscious , camp aesthetic of art rock '' to pop artist Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground , who emulated Warhol 's art/pop synthesis .
Accordingly : `` Warhol took Spector 's combination of the disembodiment , 'distance ' and refinement of high culture with the 'immediacy ' of mass cultural forms like rock and roll several stages further ...
But Warhol’s aesthetic was more thoroughly worked out than Spector 's , which represented a transitional phase between old-fashioned auteurism and the thoroughly postmodern , detached tenets of pop art .
... Warhol 's approach reverberates throughout art rock , most obviously in his stance of distance and disengagement .
`` ==== Influential albums ==== ===== 1965–66 ===== The December 1965 release of the Beatles ' Rubber Soul signified a watershed for the pop album , transforming it in scope from a collection of singles with lesser-quality tracks to a distinct art form , filled with high-quality original compositions .
The period when rock music became most closely aligned with art began in 1966 , the year in which the Beach Boys ' Pet Sounds and the Mothers of Invention 's Freak Out !
were released , and continued until the mid 1970s .
Writing in 1968 , Gene Sculatti of Jazz & Pop recognized Rubber Soul as `` the definitive 'rock as art ' album '' and `` the necessary prototype '' that major artists such as the Rolling Stones ( with Aftermath ) and the Beach Boys had felt compelled to follow .
Academic Michael Johnson associates `` the first documented moments of ascension in rock music '' to Pet Sounds .
Released in May , Pet Sounds came from Wilson 's desire to make a `` complete statement '' , believing that the Beatles ' had previously done so with Rubber Soul .
In 1978 , biographer David Leaf wrote that the album heralded art rock , while according to The New York Observer , `` Pet Sounds proved that a pop group could make an album-length piece comparable with the greatest long-form works of Bernstein , Copland , Ives , and Rodgers and Hammerstein .
`` Pet Sounds is also noted as the first rock concept album .
In 1971 , Cue magazine described the Beach Boys as having been `` among the vanguard '' with regard to art rock , among many other aspects relating to the counterculture , over the period up to late 1967 .
Jacqueline Edmondson 's 2013 encyclopedia Music in American Life states that , although it was preceded by earlier examples , Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention 's debut album Freak Out !
( June 1966 ) came to be seen as `` the first successful incorporation of art music in a pop context '' .
The writers note also that , with Los Angeles as his base since the early 1960s , Zappa was able to work in an environment where student radicalism was closely aligned with an active avant-garde scene , a setting that placed the city ahead of other countercultural centres at the time and would continue to inform his music .
Writer and pianist Michael Campbell comments that the album `` contains a long noncategorical list of Zappa 's influences , from classical avant-garde composers to obscure folk musicians '' .
The Beatles ' Revolver ( August 1966 ) furthered the album-as-art perspective and continued pop music 's evolution .
Led by the art-rock single `` Eleanor Rigby '' , it expanded the genre 's scope in terms of the range of musical styles , which included Indian , avant-garde and classical , and the lyrical content of the album , and also in its departure from previous notions of melody and structure in pop songwriting .
According to Rolling Stone , `` Revolver signaled that in popular music , anything – any theme , any musical idea – could now be realized .
`` As with Rubber Soul , the album inspired many of the progressive rock artists of the 1970s , and each of its songs has been recognised as anticipating a new subgenre or style .
===== 1967 ===== Clash Music names the Velvet Underground 's debut March 1967 album The Velvet Underground & Nico `` the original art-rock record '' .
Bannister writes of the Velvet Underground : `` no other band exerted the same grip on the minds of 1970s/1980s art/alternative rock artists , writers and audiences .
`` Their influence would recur from the 1970s onwards to various worldwide indie scenes , and in 2006 , The Velvet Underground & Nico was inducted into the Library of Congress ' National Recording Registry , who commented : `` For decades [ it ] has cast a huge shadow over nearly every sub-variety of avant-garde rock , from 70s art-rock to no-wave , new-wave , and punk .
`` However , when the Velvet Underground first appeared in the mid 1960s , they faced rejection and were commonly dismissed as a `` fag '' band .
In 1982 , musician Brian Eno famously stated that while The Velvet Underground & Nico initially sold just 30,000 copies , `` everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band .
`` The Beatles ' Paul McCartney deemed Pet Sounds `` the record of the time '' , and in June 1967 , the band responded with their own album : Sgt .
Pepper 's , which was also influenced by Freak Out !
AllMusic states that the first wave of art rock musicians were inspired by Sgt .
Pepper 's and believed that for rock music to grow artistically , they should incorporate elements of European and classical music to the genre .
Many British groups flowered in the album 's wake ; those who are listed in Music in American Life include the Moody Blues , the Strawbs , Genesis , and `` most notably '' , Pink Floyd .
The band 's Roger Waters later stated that both Sgt .
Pepper and Pet Sounds `` completely changed everything about records '' for him .
=== 1970s–90s === Art rock 's greatest level of popularity was in the early 1970s through British artists .
Enthusiasm for art rock explorations waned in the mid 1970s .
From then to the 1990s , art rock was infused within various popular music genres .
Encyclopædia Britannica states that its genre 's tendencies were continued by some British and American hard rock and pop rock artists , and that Brian Eno 's late 1970s and early 1980s collaborations with Talking Heads and David Bowie are exemplary of `` the successful infusion of art rock tendencies into other popular music genres '' .
Bowie and Eno collaborated on a series of consecutive albums called the `` Berlin Trilogy '' , characterized as an `` art rock trifecta '' by Consequence of Sound , who noted that at the time of their release , `` The experimental records weren’t connecting with audiences on the scale Bowie was used to .
... New Wave had exploded , and a generation of Bowie descendants had taken the stage .
`` In the 1980s , a new generation of English art rockers took the place of 1970s bands like Yes , Genesis , Jethro Tull and Emerson , Lake & Palmer .
Journalist Roy Trakin explains : `` Of course , these stalwarts can still fill Madison Square Garden and sell a great many records , as they always have , but their days of adventurous risk-taking and musical innovation are long gone - replaced by the smug satisfaction of commercial success .
`` Trakin identifies XTC as one of the more `` accessible '' new groups .
When the band 's Colin Moulding was asked whether he felt the band was closer to art rock or new wave , he responded ; `` We 've always had the art-rock appeal rather than street credibility .
...
I 'd like to think we 're the Vasco de Gamas [ sic ] of popular music , exploring new grounds .
This band has never really been fashionable at all .

Charles Edward Anderson Berry ( October 18 , 1926 – March 18 , 2017 ) was an American guitarist , singer and songwriter and one of the pioneers of rock and roll music .
With songs such as `` Maybellene '' ( 1955 ) , `` Roll Over Beethoven '' ( 1956 ) , `` Rock and Roll Music '' ( 1957 ) and `` Johnny B. Goode '' ( 1958 ) , Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive .
Writing lyrics that focused on teen life and consumerism , and developing a music style that included guitar solos and showmanship , Berry was a major influence on subsequent rock music .
Born into a middle-class African-American family in St. Louis , Missouri , Berry had an interest in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at Sumner High School .
While still a high school student he was convicted of armed robbery and was sent to a reformatory , where he was held from 1944 to 1947 .
After his release , Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant .
By early 1953 , influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of the blues musician T-Bone Walker , Berry began performing with the Johnnie Johnson Trio .
His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955 and met Muddy Waters , who suggested he contact Leonard Chess , of Chess Records .
With Chess , he recorded `` Maybellene '' —Berry 's adaptation of the country song `` Ida Red '' —which sold over a million copies , reaching number one on Billboard magazine 's rhythm and blues chart .
By the end of the 1950s , Berry was an established star , with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career .
He had also established his own St. Louis nightclub , Berry 's Club Bandstand .
But in January 1962 , he was sentenced to three years in prison for offenses under the Mann Act—he had transported a 14-year-old girl across state lines .
After his release in 1963 , Berry had several more hits , including `` No Particular Place to Go '' , `` You Never Can Tell '' , and `` Nadine '' .
But these did not achieve the same success , or lasting impact , of his 1950s songs , and by the 1970s he was more in demand as a nostalgic performer , playing his past hits with local backup bands of variable quality .
His insistence on being paid in cash led in 1979 to a four-month jail sentence and community service , for tax evasion .
Berry was among the first musicians to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on its opening in 1986 ; he was cited for having `` laid the groundwork for not only a rock and roll sound but a rock and roll stance .
`` Berry is included in several of Rolling Stone magazine 's `` greatest of all time '' lists ; he was ranked fifth on its 2004 and 2011 list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time .
The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 's 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll includes three of Berry 's : `` Johnny B. Goode '' , `` Maybellene '' , and `` Rock and Roll Music '' .
Berry 's `` Johnny B. Goode '' is the only rock-and-roll song included on the Voyager Golden Record .
== Biography and career == === 1926–1954 : Early life and apprenticeship with Johnnie Johnson === Born in St. Louis , Missouri , Berry was the fourth child in a family of six .
He grew up in the north St. Louis neighborhood known as the Ville , an area where many middle-class people lived .
His father , Henry William Berry ( 1895–1987 ) , was a contractor and deacon of a nearby Baptist church ; his mother , Martha Bell ( Banks ) ( 1894–1980 ) , was a certified public school principal .
Berry 's upbringing allowed him to pursue his interest in music from an early age .
He gave his first public performance in 1941 while still a student at Sumner High School ; he was still a student there in 1944 , when he was arrested for armed robbery after robbing three shops in Kansas City , Missouri , and then stealing a car at gunpoint with some friends .
Berry 's account in his autobiography is that his car broke down and he flagged down a passing car and stole it at gunpoint with a nonfunctional pistol .
He was convicted and sent to the Intermediate Reformatory for Young Men at Algoa , near Jefferson City , Missouri , where he formed a singing quartet and did some boxing .
The singing group became competent enough that the authorities allowed it to perform outside the detention facility .
Berry was released from the reformatory on his 21st birthday in 1947 .
On October 28 , 1948 , Berry married Themetta `` Toddy '' Suggs , who gave birth to Darlin Ingrid Berry on October 3 , 1950 .
Berry supported his family by taking various jobs in St. Louis , working briefly as a factory worker at two automobile assembly plants and as a janitor in the apartment building where he and his wife lived .
Afterwards he trained as a beautician at the Poro College of Cosmetology , founded by Annie Turnbo Malone .
He was doing well enough by 1950 to buy a `` small three room brick cottage with a bath '' on Whittier Street , which is now listed as the Chuck Berry House on the National Register of Historic Places .
By the early 1950s , Berry was working with local bands in clubs in St. Louis as an extra source of income .
He had been playing blues since his teens , and he borrowed both guitar riffs and showmanship techniques from the blues musician T-Bone Walker .
He also took guitar lessons from his friend Ira Harris , which laid the foundation for his guitar style .
By early 1953 Berry was performing with Johnnie Johnson 's trio , starting a long-time collaboration with the pianist .
The band played mostly blues and ballads , but the most popular music among whites in the area was country .
Berry wrote , `` Curiosity provoked me to lay a lot of our country stuff on our predominantly black audience and some of our black audience began whispering 'who is that black hillbilly at the Cosmo ?
' After they laughed at me a few times they began requesting the hillbilly stuff and enjoyed dancing to it .
`` Berry 's calculated showmanship , along with a mix of country tunes and R & B tunes , sung in the style of Nat King Cole set to the music of Muddy Waters , brought in a wider audience , particularly affluent white people .
=== 1955–1962 : Signing with Chess : `` Maybellene '' to `` Come On '' === In May 1955 , Berry traveled to Chicago , where he met Muddy Waters , who suggested he contact Leonard Chess , of Chess Records .
Berry thought his blues music would be of more interest to Chess , but to his surprise it was a traditional country fiddle tune , `` Ida Red '' , as recorded by Bob Wills , that got Chess 's attention .
Chess had seen the rhythm and blues market shrink and was looking to move beyond it , and he thought Berry might be the artist for that purpose .
On May 21 , 1955 , Berry recorded an adaptation of the song `` Ida Red '' , under the title `` Maybellene '' , with Johnnie Johnson on the piano , Jerome Green ( from Bo Diddley 's band ) on the maracas , Jasper Thomas on the drums and Willie Dixon on the bass .
`` Maybellene '' sold over a million copies , reaching number one on Billboard magazine 's rhythm and blues chart and number five on its Best Sellers in Stores chart for September 10 , 1955 .
Berry said , `` It came out at the right time when Afro-American music was spilling over into the mainstream pop .
`` At the end of June 1956 , his song `` Roll Over Beethoven '' reached number 29 on the Billboard 's Top 100 chart , and Berry toured as one of the `` Top Acts of '56 '' .
He and Carl Perkins became friends .
Perkins said that `` I knew when I first heard Chuck that he 'd been affected by country music .
I respected his writing ; his records were very , very great .
`` As they toured , Perkins discovered that Berry not only liked country music but also knew about as many songs as he did .
Jimmie Rodgers was one of his favorites .
`` Chuck knew every Blue Yodel and most of Bill Monroe 's songs as well '' , Perkins remembered .
`` He told me about how he was raised very poor , very tough .
He had a hard life .
He was a good guy .
I really liked him .
`` In late 1957 , Berry took part in Alan Freed 's `` Biggest Show of Stars for 1957 '' , touring the United States with the Everly Brothers , Buddy Holly , and others .
He was a guest on ABC 's Guy Mitchell Show , singing his hit song `` Rock 'n ' Roll Music '' .
The hits continued from 1957 to 1959 , with Berry scoring over a dozen chart singles during this period , including the US Top 10 hits `` School Days '' , `` Rock and Roll Music '' , `` Sweet Little Sixteen '' , and `` Johnny B. Goode '' .
He appeared in two early rock-and-roll movies : Rock Rock Rock ( 1956 ) , in which he sang `` You Ca n't Catch Me '' , and Go , Johnny , Go !
( 1959 ) , in which he had a speaking role as himself and performed `` Johnny B. Goode '' , `` Memphis , Tennessee '' , and `` Little Queenie '' .
His performance of `` Sweet Little Sixteen '' at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1958 was captured in the motion picture Jazz on a Summer 's Day .
By the end of the 1950s , Berry was a high-profile established star with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career .
He had opened a racially integrated St. Louis nightclub , Berry 's Club Bandstand , and invested in real estate .
But in December 1959 , he was arrested under the Mann Act after allegations that he had had sexual intercourse with a 14-year-old Apache waitress , Janice Escalante , whom he had transported across state lines to work as a hatcheck girl at his club .
After a two-week trial in March 1960 , he was convicted , fined $ 5,000 , and sentenced to five years in prison .
He appealed the decision , arguing that the judge 's comments and attitude were racist and prejudiced the jury against him .
The appeal was upheld , and a second trial was heard in May and June 1961 , resulting in another conviction and a three-year prison sentence .
After another appeal failed , Berry served one and one-half years in prison , from February 1962 to October 1963 .
He had continued recording and performing during the trials , but his output had slowed as his popularity declined ; his final single released before he was imprisoned was `` Come On '' .
=== 1963–1969 : `` Nadine '' and move to Mercury === When Berry was released from prison in 1963 his return to recording and performing was made easier because British invasion bands—notably the Beatles and the Rolling Stones—had sustained interest in his music by releasing cover versions of his songs , and other bands had reworked some of them , such as the Beach Boys ' 1963 hit `` Surfin ' U.S.A. '' , which used the melody of Berry 's `` Sweet Little Sixteen '' .
In 1964 and 1965 Berry released eight singles , including three that were commercially successful , reaching the top 20 of the Billboard 100 : `` No Particular Place to Go '' ( a humorous reworking of `` School Days '' , concerning the introduction of seat belts in cars ) , `` You Never Can Tell '' , and the rocking `` Nadine '' .
Between 1966 and 1969 Berry released five albums for Mercury Records , including his first live album , Live at Fillmore Auditorium , in which he was backed by the Steve Miller Band .
While this was not a successful period for studio work , Berry was still a top concert draw .
In May 1964 , he had made a successful tour of the UK , but when he returned in January 1965 his behavior , perhaps influenced by the injustice of his prison experience , was erratic and moody , and his touring style of using unrehearsed local backing bands and a strict nonnegotiable contract was earning him a reputation as a difficult and unexciting performer .
He also played at large events in North America , such as the Schaefer Music Festival , in New York City 's Central Park in July 1969 , and the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival festival in October .
=== 1970–1979 : Back to Chess : `` My Ding-a-Ling '' to White House concert === Berry returned to Chess from 1970 to 1973 .
There were no hit singles from the 1970 album Back Home , but in 1972 Chess released a live recording of `` My Ding-a-Ling '' , a novelty song which he had recorded in a different version as `` My Tambourine '' on his 1968 LP From St. Louie to Frisco .
The track became his only number-one single .
A live recording of `` Reelin ' and Rockin ' '' , issued as a follow-up single in the same year , was his last Top 40 hit in both the US and the UK .
Both singles were included on the part-live , part-studio album The London Chuck Berry Sessions ( other albums of London sessions were recorded by Chess 's mainstay artists Muddy Waters and Howlin ' Wolf ) .
Berry 's second tenure with Chess ended with the 1975 album Chuck Berry , after which he did not make a studio record until Rock It for Atco Records in 1979 , which would be his last studio album for 38 years .
In the 1970s Berry toured on the strength of his earlier successes .
He was on the road for many years , carrying only his Gibson guitar , confident that he could hire a band that already knew his music no matter where he went .
AllMusic said that in this period his `` live performances became increasingly erratic , ... working with terrible backup bands and turning in sloppy , out-of-tune performances '' which `` tarnished his reputation with younger fans and oldtimers '' alike .
In March 1972 he was filmed , at the BBC Television Theatre in Shepherds Bush , for Chuck Berry in Concert , part of a 60-date tour backed by the band Rocking Horse .
Among the many bandleaders performing a backup role with Berry in the 1970s were Bruce Springsteen and Steve Miller when each was just starting his career .
Springsteen related in the documentary film Hail !
Hail !
Rock 'n ' Roll that Berry did not give the band a set list and expected the musicians to follow his lead after each guitar intro .
Berry neither spoke to nor thanked the band after the show .
Nevertheless , Springsteen backed Berry again when he appeared at the concert for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 .
At the request of Jimmy Carter , Berry performed at the White House on June 1 , 1979 .
Berry 's touring style , traveling the `` oldies '' circuit in the 1970s ( often being paid in cash by local promoters ) added ammunition to the Internal Revenue Service 's accusations that Berry had evaded paying income taxes .
Facing criminal sanction for the third time , Berry pleaded guilty to tax evasion and was sentenced to four months in prison and 1,000 hours of community service—performing benefit concerts—in 1979 .
=== 1980–2017 : Last years on the road === Berry continued to play 70 to 100 one-nighters per year in the 1980s , still traveling solo and requiring a local band to back him at each stop .
In 1986 , Taylor Hackford made a documentary film , Hail !
Hail !
Rock 'n ' Roll , of a celebration concert for Berry 's sixtieth birthday , organized by Keith Richards .
Eric Clapton , Etta James , Julian Lennon , Robert Cray and Linda Ronstadt , among others , appeared with Berry on stage and in the film .
During the concert , Berry played a Gibson ES-355 , the luxury version of the ES-335 that he favored on his 1970s tours .
Richards played a black Fender Telecaster Custom , Cray a Fender Stratocaster and Clapton a Gibson ES 350T , the same model that Berry used on his early recordings .
In the late 1980s , Berry bought the Southern Air , a restaurant in Wentzville , Missouri .
In 1990 he was sued by several women who claimed that he had installed a video camera in the bathroom .
Berry claimed that he had the camera installed to catch a worker who was suspected of stealing from the restaurant .
Though his guilt was never proved in court , Berry opted for a class action settlement .
( One of the biographers , Bruce Pegg , estimated that , with 59 women , it cost Berry over $ 1.2 million plus legal fees. ) .
His lawyers said he had been the victim of a conspiracy to profit from his wealth .
During this time Berry began using Wayne T. Schoeneberg as his legal counsel .
Reportedly , a police raid on his house found intimate videotapes of women , one of whom being apparently a minor .
Also found in the raid were 62 grams of marijuana .
Felony drug and child-abuse charges were filed .
As the child-abuse charges were dropped , Berry agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor possession of marijuana .
He was given a six-month suspended jail sentence and two years ' unsupervised probation and was ordered to donate $ 5,000 to a local hospital .
In November 2000 , Berry faced legal issues when he was sued by his former pianist Johnnie Johnson , who claimed that he had co-written over 50 songs , including `` No Particular Place to Go '' , `` Sweet Little Sixteen '' and `` Roll Over Beethoven '' , that credit Berry alone .
The case was dismissed when the judge ruled that too much time had passed since the songs were written .
In 2008 , Berry toured Europe , with stops in Sweden , Norway , Finland , the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , Ireland , Switzerland , Poland and Spain .
In mid-2008 , he played at the Virgin Festival in Baltimore , Maryland .
During a concert on New Year 's Day 2011 in Chicago , Berry , suffering from exhaustion , passed out and had to be helped off stage .
Berry lived in Ladue , Missouri , approximately 10 miles ( 16 km ) west of St. Louis .
He regularly performed one Wednesday each month at Blueberry Hill , a restaurant and bar located in the Delmar Loop neighborhood of St. Louis , from 1996 to 2014 .
Berry announced on his 90th birthday that his first new studio album since Rock It in 1979 , entitled Chuck , would be released in 2017 .
His first new record in 38 years , it includes his children , Charles Berry Jr. and Ingrid , on guitar and harmonica , with songs `` covering the spectrum from hard-driving rockers to soulful thought-provoking time capsules of a life 's work '' and dedicated to his beloved wife of 68 years , Toddy .
=== Death and funeral === On March 18 , 2017 , police in St. Charles County , Missouri , were called to Berry 's house , where he was found unresponsive .
He was pronounced dead at the scene , aged 90 .
TMZ website posted an audio recording in which the 911 operator can be heard responding to a reported `` cardiac arrest '' at Berry 's home .
Berry 's funeral was held on April 9 , 2017 , at The Pageant , in Berry 's hometown of St. Louis , Missouri .
He was remembered in rock 'n ' roll style with a public viewing by family , friends , and fans in The Pageant , a music club where he often performed , with his beloved cherry-red guitar bolted to the inside lid of the coffin and with flower arrangements that included one sent by the Rolling Stones in the shape of a guitar .
Afterwards a private service was held in the club celebrating Berry 's life and musical career , with the Berry family inviting 300 members of the public into the service .
Gene Simmons of KISS gave an impromptu , unadvertised eulogy at the service , while Little Richard was scheduled to lead the funeral procession but did not show up due to an illness .
The night before , many St. Louis area bars held a mass toast at 10 pm in Berry 's honor .
== Legacy == A pioneer of rock and roll , Berry was a significant influence on the development of both the music and the attitude associated with the rock music lifestyle .
With songs such as `` Maybellene '' ( 1955 ) , `` Roll Over Beethoven '' ( 1956 ) , `` Rock and Roll Music '' ( 1957 ) and `` Johnny B. Goode '' ( 1958 ) , Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive , with lyrics successfully aimed to appeal to the early teenage market by using graphic and humorous descriptions of teen dances , fast cars , high school life , and consumer culture , and utilizing guitar solos and showmanship that would be a major influence on subsequent rock music .
Thus Berry , the songwriter , invented rock as `` a music of teenage wishes fulfilled and good times ( even with cops in pursuit ) .
`` Berry contributed three things to rock music : an irresistible swagger , a focus on the guitar riff as the primary melodic element and an emphasis on songwriting as storytelling .
His records are a rich storehouse of the essential lyrical , showmanship and musical components of rock and roll .
In addition to the Beatles and the Rolling Stones , a large number of significant popular-music performers have recorded Berry 's songs .
Though not technically accomplished , his guitar style is distinctive—he incorporated electronic effects to mimic the sound of bottleneck blues guitarists and drew on the influence of guitar players such as Carl Hogan , and T-Bone Walker to produce a clear and exciting sound that many later guitarists would acknowledge as an influence in their own style .
Berry 's showmanship has been influential on other rock guitarists , particularly his one-legged hop routine , and the `` duck walk '' , which he first used as a child when he walked `` stooping with full-bended knees , but with my back and head vertical '' under a table to retrieve a ball and his family found it entertaining ; he used it when `` performing in New York for the first time and some journalist branded it the duck walk .
`` On July 29 , 2011 , Berry was honored in a dedication of an eight-foot , in-motion Chuck Berry Statue in the Delmar Loop in St. Louis , Missouri , right across the street from Blue Berry Hill .
Berry said , `` It 's glorious -- I do appreciate it to the highest , no doubt about it .
That sort of honor is seldom given out .
But I do n't deserve it .
`` ( Daniel Durchholz ( July 29 , 2011 ) .
`` Chuck Berry Statue Unveiled in St .
Louis .
`` `` Rolling Stone .
`` ) The rock critic Robert Christgau considers Berry `` the greatest of the rock and rollers '' , while John Lennon said , `` if you tried to give rock and roll another name , you might call it 'Chuck Berry ' .
`` Ted Nugent said , `` If you do n't know every Chuck Berry lick , you ca n't play rock guitar .
`` Bob Dylan called Berry `` the Shakespeare of rock 'n ' roll '' .
Springsteen tweeted , `` Chuck Berry was rock 's greatest practitioner , guitarist , and the greatest pure rock 'n ' roll writer who ever lived .
`` When asked what caused the explosion of the popularity of rock 'n roll that took place in the 1950s , with him and a handful of others , mainly him , Berry said , `` Well , actually they begin to listen to it , you see , because certain stations played certain music .
The music that we , the blacks , played , the cultures were so far apart , we would have to have a play station in order to play it .
The cultures begin to come together , and you begin to see one another 's vein of life , then the music came together .
`` Among the honors Berry received were the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1984 and the Kennedy Center Honors in 2000 .
He was ranked seventh on Time magazine 's 2009 list of the 10 best electric guitar players of all time .
On May 14 , 2002 , Berry was honored as one of the first BMI Icons at the 50th annual BMI Pop Awards .
He was presented the award along with BMI affiliates Bo Diddley and Little Richard .
In August 2014 , Berry was made a laureate of the Polar Music Prize .
Berry is included in several of Rolling Stone magazine 's `` Greatest of All Time '' lists .
In September 2003 , the magazine ranked him number 6 in its list of the `` 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time '' .
In November his compilation album The Great Twenty-Eight was ranked 21st in Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time .
In March 2004 , Berry was ranked fifth on the list of `` The Immortals – The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time '' .
In December 2004 , six of his songs were included in `` Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time '' : `` Johnny B. Goode '' ( # 7 ) , `` Maybellene '' ( # 18 ) , `` Roll Over Beethoven '' ( # 97 ) , `` Rock and Roll Music '' ( # 128 ) , `` Sweet Little Sixteen '' ( # 272 ) and `` Brown Eyed Handsome Man '' ( # 374 ) .
In June 2008 , his song `` Johnny B. Goode '' was ranked first in the `` 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time '' .
The journalist Chuck Klosterman has argued that in 300 years Berry will still be remembered as the rock musician who most closely captured the essence of rock and roll .
Time magazine stated , `` There was no one like Elvis .
But there was 'definitely ' no one like Chuck Berry .
`` `` Rolling Stone '' magazine called him `` the father of rock & roll '' who `` gave the music its sound and its attitude , even as he battled racism - and his own misdeeds - all the way , '' reporting that Leonard Cohen said , `` All of us are footnotes to the words of Chuck Berry .
`` ( Mikal Gilmore , `` Chuck Berry 1926-2017 , '' `` Rolling Stone , '' pp .
23–24 , April 20 , 2017 ) Kevin Strait , curator of the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington , DC , said that Berry is `` one of the primary sonic architects of rock and roll .

Gary Anthony James Webb ( born 8 March 1958 ) , professionally known as Gary Numan , is an English singer , songwriter , musician , and record producer and artist .
Born in Hammersmith , London , he first entered the music industry as the lead singer of the new wave band Tubeway Army .
After releasing two albums with the band , Numan released his debut solo album The Pleasure Principle in 1979 .
Most widely known for his chart-topping hits `` Are 'Friends ' Electric ?
`` and `` Cars '' , Numan achieved his peak of mainstream popularity in the late 1970s and early 1980s , but maintains a loyal cult following .
His signature sound consists of heavy synthesizer hooks fed through guitar effects pedals , and he is considered a pioneer of commercial electronic music .
Numan is also known for his distinctive voice and androgynous `` android '' persona .
== Early life == Born in Hammersmith , London , Numan was the son of a British Airways bus driver based at Heathrow Airport .
He was educated at Town Farm Junior School in Stanwell , Surrey , Ashford County Grammar School , then Slough Grammar School in Berkshire , followed by Brooklands Technical College in Surrey .
He joined the Air Training Corps as a teenager .
He then briefly held various jobs including forklift truck driver , air conditioning ventilator fitter , and accounts clerk .
When Numan was 15 years old , his father bought him a Gibson Les Paul , which he regards as his most treasured possession .
He played in various bands , including Mean Street and The Lasers , before forming Tubeway Army with his uncle , Jess Lidyard , and Paul Gardiner .
His initial pseudonym was `` Valerian '' , probably in reference to the hero in French science fiction comic series Valérian and Laureline .
He later picked the surname `` Numan '' from an advert in the Yellow Pages for a plumber whose surname was `` Neumann '' .
== Career == === 1970s === ==== Tubeway Army ==== Numan rose to prominence at the end of the 1970s as front man , writer , and producer for Tubeway Army .
After recording an album 's worth of punk-influenced demo tapes ( released in 1984 as The Plan ) , he was signed by Beggars Banquet Records in 1978 and quickly released two singles , `` That 's Too Bad '' and `` Bombers '' , neither of which charted .
A self-titled , new wave-oriented debut album later that same year sold out its limited run and introduced Numan 's fascination with dystopian science fiction and synthesizers .
Tubeway Army 's third single , the dark-themed and slow-paced `` Down in the Park '' ( 1979 ) , also failed to chart , but it would prove to be one of Numan 's most enduring and oft-covered songs .
It was featured with other contemporary hits on the soundtrack for the movie Times Square , and a live version of the song can be seen in the movie Urgh !
A Music War .
Following exposure in a television advertisement for Lee Cooper jeans with the jingle `` Do n't be a Dummy '' , Tubeway Army released the single `` Are 'Friends ' Electric ?
`` in May 1979 .
The single took seven weeks before finally reaching No .
1 at the end of June ; the parent album Replicas simultaneously reached No .
1 .
==== As Gary Numan ==== A few months later Numan found success in the charts on both sides of the Atlantic with `` Cars '' , which peaked at No .
1 in the UK in 1979 , No .
1 in Canada and No .
9 in the US in 1980 .
`` Cars '' and the 1979 album The Pleasure Principle were both released under Numan 's own stage name .
The album reached number one in the UK , and a sell-out tour ( 'The Touring Principle ' ) followed ; the concert video it spawned is often cited as the first full-length commercial music video release .
The Pleasure Principle was a rock album with no guitars ; instead , Numan used synthesizers fed through guitar effects pedals to achieve a distorted , phased , metallic tone .
A second single from the album , `` Complex '' , made it to No .
6 in the UK charts .
==== Personality and style ==== Around this time , Numan also developed his style .
According to Numan , this was an unintentional result of acne ; before an appearance on Top of the Pops , he had `` spots everywhere , so they slapped about half an inch of white makeup on me before I 'd even walked in the door .
And my eyes were like pissholes in the snow , so they put black on there .
My so-called image fell into place an hour before going on the show '' .
His `` wooden '' stage presence was , in his words , a result of extreme self-consciousness and lack of `` showmanship '' and often referred to as being `` like an android '' .
During this period , Numan generated an army of fans calling themselves `` Numanoids '' , providing him with a fanbase which maintained their support through the latter half of the 1980s , when his fortunes began to fall precipitously .
He later said that he `` ... got really hung up with this whole thing of not feeling , being cold about everything , not letting emotions get to you , or presenting a front of not feeling '' .
=== 1980s === In 1980 , Numan topped the album charts for a third time with Telekon , with the singles `` We Are Glass '' , `` I Die : You Die '' released prior to the album reaching No .
5 and No .
6 .
`` This Wreckage '' taken from the album in December also entered the Top 20 .
Telekon , the final studio album that Numan retrospectively termed the `` Machine '' section of his career , reintroduced guitars to Numan 's music and featured a wider range of synthesizers .
The same year he embarked on his second major tour ( `` The Teletour '' ) with an even more elaborate stage show than The Touring Principle the previous year .
He announced his retirement from touring with a series of sell-out concerts at Wembley Arena in April 1981 , supported by experimental musician Nash the Slash and Shock , a rock/mime/burlesque troupe whose members included Barbie Wilde , Tik and Tok , and Carole Caplin .
A live two album set from the 1979 and 1980 tours released at this time reached No .
2 in the charts .
Both albums , also individually released as Living Ornaments '79 and Living Ornaments '80 also charted .
The decision to retire would be short-lived .
Departing from the pure electropop that he had been associated with , Numan began experimenting with jazz , funk , and ethereal , rhythmic pop .
His first album after his 1981 farewell concerts was Dance ( 1981 ) .
The album charted as high as No .
3 on the UK charts , with an eight-week chart run and produced one hit single ( `` She 's Got Claws '' ) reaching No .
6 .
The album featured several distinguished guest players ; Mick Karn ( bass , saxophone ) and Rob Dean ( guitar ) of Japan , Roger Mason ( keyboards ) of Models , and Roger Taylor ( drums ) of Queen .
With his former backing band , Chris John Payne ( keyboards , viola ) , Russell Bell ( guitar ) , and Ced Sharpley ( drums ) now reformed as Dramatis , Numan contributed vocals to the minor hit `` Love Needs No Disguise '' from the album For Future Reference and lent vocals to the first single release by his long-term right-hand man Paul Gardiner , `` Stormtrooper in Drag '' , which also made the charts .
However , Numan 's career had begun to experience a gradual decline , and he was eclipsed initially by acts such as Adam Ant , and later by The Human League , Duran Duran , and Depeche Mode .
Each album also saw a new `` image '' , none of which captured the public 's imagination to nearly the same extent as the lonely android of 1979 .
The album I , Assassin ( 1982 ) fared less well than Dance .
Despite producing one Top 10 and two Top 20 singles , the album peaked at No .
8 with a six-week chart run .
Numan supported the album with a concert tour in America in late 1982 ( where he was living as a tax exile ) , which were his first series of live shows since his farewell at Wembley .
Warriors ( 1983 ) further developed Numan 's jazz-influenced style and featured contributions from avant-garde musician Bill Nelson ( who fell out with Numan during recording and chose to be uncredited as the album 's co-producer ) , and saxophonist Dick Morrissey ( who would play on most of Numan 's albums until 1991 ) .
The album peaked at No .
12 , produced two hit singles including the Top 20 title track and , like I , Assassin , spent six weeks in the charts .
Warriors was the last album Numan recorded for Beggars Banquet Records , and was supported by a 40-date UK tour ( again with support from robotic mime and music duo Tik and Tok ) —Numan 's first live tour in the UK since his Wembley appearances in 1981 .
Numan subsequently issued a series of albums and singles on his own record label , Numa .
The first album released on Numa , 1984 's Berserker was also notable for being Numan 's first foray into music computers/samplers , in this case the PPG Wave .
Berserker moved away from the fluid , fretless sound that characterised Numan 's previous three albums , featuring instead harder-edged electric bass and drum sounds .
The album was also accompanied by a new blue-and-white visual image ( including Numan himself with blue hair ) , a tour , a live album/video/EP , and the title track reached the UK Top 40 when released as a single .
Despite this , the album divided critics and fans and commercially it was Numan 's least successful release to that point .
Numan 's next album , The Fury ( 1985 ) , charted slightly higher than Berserker breaking the top 30 .
Again , the album heralded a change of image , this time featuring Numan in a white suit and red bow tie .
Four singles were released from the album , all reaching the UK Top 50 .
Collaborations with Bill Sharpe of Shakatak as Sharpe & Numan helped little , though two singles that the duo recorded did see chart action : `` Change Your Mind '' , reached No .
17 in 1985 , and `` No More Lies '' reached No .
35 in 1988 .
Numa Records , which had been launched in a flurry of idealistic excitement , folded after the release of Numan 's 1986 album Strange Charm , though the album did contain two top 30 hits ( Numan 's highest singles chart placings since 1983 ) .
In addition to Numa Records ' commercial failure , Numan 's own fortune amassed since the late 1970s , which he estimated at £4.5 million , was drained .
Numan then signed to IRS Records though his final studio album of the 1980s , Metal Rhythm ( 1988 ) , also sold relatively poorly .
For its American release , the record label changed the album 's title to New Anger after the album 's lead single , changed the album colour from black to blue , and remixed several of its tracks against Numan 's wishes .
In 1989 , the Sharpe and Numan album Automatic was released through Polydor Records , though this too failed to garner much commercial success , briefly entering the charts .
=== 1990s === In 1991 , Numan ventured into film-scoring by co-composing the music for The Unborn with Michael R. Smith ( the score was later released as an instrumental album in 1995 , Human ) .
After Outland ( 1991 ) , another critical and commercial disappointment and his second and last studio album with IRS , Numan reactivated Numa Records , under which he would release his next two albums .
He supported Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark ( who had opened for him in 1979 ) on a 1993 arena tour .
By 1994 , Numan decided to stop attempting to crack the pop market and concentrate instead on exploring more personal themes , including his vocal atheism .
His future wife Gemma encouraged him to strip away the influences of the more recent years .
Numan re-evaluated his career and veered toward a harsher , more industrial direction with his songwriting on the album Sacrifice—for the first time he played almost all the instruments himself .
The move was critically well-received , as Numan 's harder and darker sound emerged just as Numan-influenced bands like Nine Inch Nails were enjoying their first rush of fame .
The influence was two-way ; Numan claimed that Nine Inch Nails ' song `` Closer '' is his favourite hit single of all time , and influenced his music .
Sacrifice was the last album Numan made before shutting down Numa Records permanently .
His next two albums , Exile ( 1997 ) and Pure ( 2000 ) , were well received and significantly helped to restore his critical reputation .
Numan toured the US in support of Exile , his first stateside concerts since the early 1980s .
Fear Factory produced a cover of `` Cars '' ( featuring a prominent guest appearance by Numan himself ) for the digipak version of their 1999 album , Obsolete .
=== 2000s === Numan had become acknowledged and respected by his peers , with such musicians as Dave Grohl ( of Foo Fighters and Nirvana ) , Trent Reznor ( of Nine Inch Nails ) , and Marilyn Manson proclaiming his work an influence and recording cover versions of old Numan hits .
The band Basement Jaxx had a huge hit in 2002 with `` Where 's Your Head At ?
`` , which relied on a sample of Numan 's `` M.E .
`` —from The Pleasure Principle—for its hook .
Nine Inch Nails covered the song `` Metal '' on The Fragile remix album Things Falling Apart as did Afrika Bambaataa ( with Numan himself ) on the album Dark Matter Moving at the Speed of Light .
`` Cars '' remains Numan 's most enduring song ; it was a hit again in 1987 ( remixed by Zeus B .
Held ) and 1996 , in the latter case thanks to an appearance in an advert for Carling beer .
In 2000 , DJ Armand Van Helden sampled the track and mixed it up in his single `` Koochy '' which conquered the dancefloors .
In 2002 , UK pop trio Sugababes scored a No .
1 with `` Freak Like Me '' —a mashup of Adina Howard 's `` Freak Like Me '' and `` Are Friends Electric ?
`` by Numan 's Tubeway Army .
In 2002 , Numan enjoyed chart success once again with the single `` Rip '' , reaching No .
29 in the UK chart and in 2003 with the Gary Numan vs Rico single `` Crazier '' , which reached No .
13 in the UK chart .
Rico also worked on the remix album Hybrid which featured reworkings of older songs in a more contemporary industrial style as well as new material .
Other artists and producers who contributed on these remixes included Curve , Flood , Andy Gray , Alan Moulder , New Disease , and Sulpher .
2003 also saw Numan performing the vocals on a track named `` Pray For You '' on the Plump DJs album Eargasm .
In 2004 , Numan took control of his own business affairs again , launching the label Mortal Records and releasing a series of live DVDs .
On 13 March 2006 , Numan 's album , Jagged , was released .
An album launch gig took place at The Forum , London on 18 March followed by UK , European and US tours in support of the release .
Numan also launched a Jagged website to showcase the new album , and made plans to have his 1981 farewell concert ( previously released as Micromusic on VHS ) issued on DVD by November 2006 as well as releasing the DVD version of the Jagged album launch gig .
Numan undertook a Telekon 'Classic Album ' tour in the UK in December 2006 .
Numan contributed vocals to four tracks on the April 2007 release of the debut solo album by Ade Fenton Artificial Perfect on his new industrial/electronic label Submission , including songs `` The Leather Sea '' , `` Slide Away '' , `` Recall '' , and the first single to be taken from the album , `` Healing '' .
The second single to be released in the UK was `` The Leather Sea '' on 30 July 2007 , which charted .
He sold out a fifteen-date UK & Ireland tour in spring 2008 during which he performed his 1979 number one album Replicas in full , and all the Replicas-era music including B-sides .
The successful tour also raised Numan 's profile in the media again due to the fact that it coincided with his 30th anniversary in the music business .
In November 2007 , Numan confirmed via his website that work on a new album , with the working title of Splinter , would be under way throughout 2008 , after finishing an alternate version of Jagged ( called Jagged Edge ) and the CD of unreleased songs from his previous three albums ( confirmed to be titled Dead Son Rising on 1 December 2008 via official mailing list message ) .
He wrote that Splinter was likely to be released in early 2010 .
In a September 2009 interview with The Quietus , Numan said that he and Trent Reznor planned to make music together .
=== 2010s === Numan was set to perform a small number of American live dates in April 2010 , including a Coachella Festival appearance in California , but had to cancel because air travel in Europe was halted by the Icelandic volcanic ash cloud .
As a result , the tour was not only postponed but expanded , and his Pleasure Principle 30th Anniversary Tour 's American and Mexican dates began on 17 October 2010 , at Firestone Live in Orlando , Florida .
Numan toured Australia in May 2011 performing his seminal album The Pleasure Principle in its entirety to celebrate its thirtieth anniversary .
Joining him on tour was Australian electronic band Severed Heads , coming out of retirement especially for the shows .
Numan lent his vocals to the track `` My Machines '' on Battles 's 2011 album Gloss Drop .
He was chosen by Battles to perform at the ATP Nightmare Before Christmas festival that they co-curated in December 2011 in Minehead , England .
Numan 's new album Dead Son Rising was released on 16 September 2011 which had a full UK tour split in two halves , 15–21 September and 7–11 December , Both parts were supported by Welsh soloist Jayce Lewis in an interview during the tour ; Numan praised Lewis for being the best supporting act ever in his 30 years of touring , later documenting the tour in a tour diary and publicly inviting Lewis to join him for an American tour in 2012 .
Numan also provided narration for Voltaire 's short film Odokuro in 2011 .
While working on a new album due for release in 2013 , Numan said `` The one I 'm working on now which I 'm trying to get out in the middle of next year .
It 's very heavy , very aggressive and very dark .
There are elements of Dead Son Rising in that , but it 's much further along that particular road .
`` The new album , Splinter ( Songs From A Broken Mind ) , was released on 14 October 2013 .
The album reached the UK Top 20 , his first album to do so for 30 years .
It was promoted by an extensive US , Canada , UK & Ireland tour which continued in 2014 to include Israel , New Zealand , Australia and Europe .
A further US leg took place in late 2014 .
In June 2014 , Numan collaborated with Jayce Lewis and his Protafield project on the track `` Redesign '' featured on Protafield 's Nemesis Album .
Numan also provided vocals for the song `` Long Way Down '' composed by Masafumi Takada and Rich Dickerson for The Evil Within video game .
The game was released on 14 October 2014 .
Numan performed a sold-out , one-off live show in London in November 2014 at the Hammersmith Apollo supported by Gang of Four .
On 29 April 2015 , Numan announced via his Facebook page that he had begun writing songs for the follow-up album to Splinter ( Songs from a Broken Mind ) .
Numan collaborated with Industrial Pop group VOWWS for `` Losing Myself In You '' in their debut album The Great Sun .
On 6 May 2016 , Numan was one of several collaborators on Jean-Michel Jarre 's album Electronica 2 : The Heart of Noise , with the track `` Here for you '' , co-written by Jarre and Numan .
On 10 May 2016 , Numan was named the recipient of the 2016 Moog Innovation Award by Moog Music .
On 18th May 2017 , Numan was awarded an Ivor Novello for Inspiration award in London .
In July 2017 it was announced that the 22nd Gary Numan album Savage ( Songs From A Broken World ) was set for release on 15 September .
It was preceded by the single `` My Name Is Ruin '' and will follow a European tour in October .
== Personal life == Numan is a positive atheist and has incorporated anti-religious motifs and images in his music .
He was an outspoken supporter of the Conservative Party and of Margaret Thatcher after her inauguration as Prime Minister .
He later expressed regret for giving his public support , calling it `` a noose around my neck '' .
He has previously said that he considers himself neither left-wing nor right-wing and that he does not support Tony Blair or David Cameron .
Numan also said , `` I 'm not socialist , I know that .
I do n't believe in sharing my money .
`` In 1997 , Numan married Gemma O'Neill , a member of his fan club from Sidcup .
Numan used to reside with his family in East Sussex , until he moved to Los Angeles , California in October 2012 .
He published his autobiography , Praying to the Aliens , in 1997 ( updated edition 1998 ) , in collaboration with Steve Malins .
( Malins also wrote the liner notes for most of the CD reissues of Numan 's albums in the late 1990s , as well as executive producing the Hybrid album in 2003 .
) At age 15 , after a series of outbursts in which Numan would `` smash things up , scream and shout , get in people 's faces and break stuff '' , he was prescribed antidepressants and anxiolytics .
Numan 's wife later suggested he had Asperger syndrome ; after reading about the syndrome and taking a series of online tests , he agreed , and identified himself as having AS , though he has not professionally been diagnosed with it .
In a 2001 interview , he said , `` Polite conversation has never been one of my strong points .
Just recently I actually found out that I 'd got a mild form of Asperger 's syndrome which basically means I have trouble interacting with people .
For years , I could n't understand why people thought I was arrogant , but now it all makes more sense .
`` Following the apparent harassment of his wife while his family was walking on a high street in his local area , and his feelings following the 2011 London riots , Numan filed papers to emigrate to Santa Monica , California .
Numan said , `` Every village and town in England has a bunch of thugs running around in it .
The riots were the nail in the coffin .
`` In the September 2011 Q & A section of Numan 's official web site , in answer to the question , `` Is it true you now hate England and want to leave ?
`` he replied , `` No , that 's utter rubbish .
`` He explained that he had `` never been abused in my local high street '' and has `` made no firm decision about leaving the UK '' , but thugs are helping make such a decision , pointing out that the rioting `` makes us look like a country of ignorant savages , beating up people already injured , pretending to help while stealing their things , hitting old men , killing them '' .
He went on to explain that soundtracks may be a logical step , as he gets older and since `` in the UK we have no meaningful film industry to speak of '' , a move to the U.S. might be more reasonable .
He concluded by saying his family are highest priority and , `` If I see somewhere that seems safer , happier , and will give them a better life than the UK , I 'll take them there if I possibly can .

The Peter Gunn theme won the first Grammy Award for Album of the Year .
Mancini also had a long collaboration on film scores with the film director Blake Edwards .
== Early life == Mancini was born in the Little Italy neighborhood of Cleveland , and was raised near Pittsburgh , in the steel town of West Aliquippa , Pennsylvania .
His parents immigrated from the Abruzzo region of Italy .
Mancini 's father , Quinto ( born March 13 , 1893 , Scanno , Italy ) was a steelworker , who made his only child begin piccolo lessons at the age of eight .
When Mancini was 12 years old , he began piano lessons .
Quinto and Henry played flute together in the Aliquippa Italian immigrant band , `` Sons of Italy '' .
After graduating from Aliquippa High School in 1942 , Mancini attended the renowned Juilliard School of Music in New York .
In 1943 , after roughly one year at Juilliard , his studies were interrupted when he was drafted into the United States Army .
He initially served in the infantry , later transferring to an Army band .
In 1945 , he participated in the liberation of the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp in Austria .
== Career == Newly discharged , Mancini entered the music industry .
Entering 1946 , he became a pianist and arranger for the newly re-formed Glenn Miller Orchestra , led by 'Everyman ' Tex Beneke .
After World War II , Mancini broadened his skills in composition , counterpoint , harmony and orchestration during studies opening with the composers Ernst Krenek and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco .
In 1952 , Mancini joined the Universal Pictures music department .
During the next six years , he contributed music to over 100 movies , most notably Creature from the Black Lagoon , The Creature Walks Among Us , It Came from Outer Space , Tarantula , This Island Earth , The Glenn Miller Story ( for which he received his first Academy Award nomination ) , The Benny Goodman Story and Orson Welles ' Touch of Evil .
During this time , he also wrote some popular songs .
His first hit was a single by Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians titled I Wo n't Let You Out of My Heart .
Mancini left Universal-International to work as an independent composer/arranger in 1958 .
Soon afterward , he scored the television series Peter Gunn for writer/producer Blake Edwards .
This was the genesis of a relationship in which Edwards and Mancini collaborated on 30 films over 35 years .
Along with Alex North , Elmer Bernstein , Leith Stevens and Johnny Mandel , Henry Mancini was a pioneer of the inclusion of jazz elements in the late romantic orchestral film and TV scoring prevalent at the time .
Mancini 's scores for Blake Edwards included Breakfast at Tiffany 's ( with the standard `` Moon River '' ) and Days of Wine and Roses ( with the title song , `` Days of Wine and Roses '' ) , as well as Experiment in Terror , The Pink Panther ( and all of its sequels ) , The Great Race , The Party , 10 ( including `` It 's Easy to Say '' ) and Victor Victoria .
Another director with whom Mancini had a longstanding partnership was Stanley Donen ( Charade , Arabesque , Two for the Road ) .
Mancini also composed for Howard Hawks ( Man 's Favorite Sport ? , Hatari !
– which included the well-known `` Baby Elephant Walk '' ) , Martin Ritt ( The Molly Maguires ) , Vittorio de Sica ( Sunflower ) , Norman Jewison ( Gaily , Gaily ) , Paul Newman ( Sometimes a Great Notion , The Glass Menagerie ) , Stanley Kramer ( Oklahoma Crude ) , George Roy Hill ( The Great Waldo Pepper ) , Arthur Hiller ( Silver Streak ) , Ted Kotcheff ( Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe ?
) , and others .
Mancini 's score for the Alfred Hitchcock film Frenzy ( 1972 ) in Bachian organ andante , for organ and an orchestra of strings was rejected and replaced by Ron Goodwin 's work .
Mancini scored many TV movies , including The Moneychangers , The Thorn Birds and The Shadow Box .
He wrote many television themes , including Mr. Lucky ( starring John Vivyan and Ross Martin ) , NBC Mystery Movie , What 's Happening !
! , Tic Tac Dough ( 1990 version ) and Once Is Not Enough .
In the 1984–85 television season , four series featured original Mancini themes : Newhart , Hotel , Remington Steele , and Ripley 's Believe It or Not .
Mancini also composed the `` Viewer Mail '' theme for Late Night with David Letterman .
Mancini composed the theme for NBC Nightly News used beginning in 1975 , and a different theme by him , titled Salute to the President was used by NBC News for its election coverage ( including primaries and conventions ) from 1976 to 1992 .
Salute to the President was only published in a school-band arrangement , although Mancini performed it frequently with symphony orchestras on his concert tours .
Songs with music by Mancini were staples of the easy listening genre from the 1960s to the 1980s .
Some of the artists who have recorded Mancini songs include Andy Williams , Paul Anka , Pat Boone , Anita Bryant , Jack Jones , Frank Sinatra , Perry Como , Connie Francis , Eydie Gorme , Steve Lawrence , Trini Lopez , George Maharis , Johnny Mathis , Jerry Vale , Ray Conniff , Quincy Jones , The Lennon Sisters , The Lettermen , Herb Alpert , Eddie Cano , Frank Chacksfield , Warren Covington , Sarah Vaughn , Shelly Manne , James Moody , Percy Faith , Ferrante & Teicher , Horst Jankowski , Andre Kostelanetz , Peter Nero , Liberace , Mantovani , Tony Bennett , Julie London , Wayne Newton , Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra , Peggy Lee , and Matt Monro .
The Anita Kerr Quartet won a Grammy award ( 1965 ) for their album `` We Dig Mancini '' , a cover of his songs .
Lawrence Welk held Mancini in very high regard , and frequently featured Mancini 's music on The Lawrence Welk Show ( Mancini made at least one guest appearance on the show ) .
Mancini recorded over 90 albums , in styles ranging from big band to light classical to pop .
Eight of these albums were certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America .
He had a 20-year contract with RCA Victor , resulting in 60 commercial record albums that made him a household name among artists of easy-listening music .
Mancini 's earliest recordings in the 1950s and early 1960s were of the jazz idiom ; with the success of Peter Gunn , Mr. Lucky , and Breakfast at Tiffany 's , Mancini shifted to primarily recording his own music in record albums and film soundtracks .
( Relatively little of his music was written for recordings compared to the amount that was written for film and television .
) Beginning with his 1969 hit arrangement of Nino Rota 's A Time for Us ( as his only Billboard Hot 100 top 10 entry , the # 1 hit `` Love Theme from Romeo and Juliet '' ) and its accompanying album A Warm Shade of Ivory , Mancini began to function more as a piano soloist and easy-listening artist primarily recording music written by other people .
In this period , for two of his best-selling albums he was joined by trumpet virtuoso and The Tonight Show bandleader Doc Severinsen .
Among Mancini 's orchestral scores are ( Lifeforce , The Great Mouse Detective , Sunflower , Tom and Jerry : The Movie , Molly Maguires , The Hawaiians ) , and darker themes ( Experiment in Terror , The White Dawn , Wait Until Dark , The Night Visitor ) .
Mancini was also a concert performer , conducting over fifty engagements per year , resulting in over 600 symphony performances during his lifetime .
He conducted nearly all of the leading symphonies of the world , including the London Symphony Orchestra , the Israel Philharmonic , the Boston Pops , the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra .
One of his favorites was the Minnesota Orchestra , where he debuted the Thorn Birds Suite in June 1983 .
He appeared in 1966 , 1980 and 1984 in command performances for the British Royal Family .
He also toured several times with Johnny Mathis and also with Andy Williams , who had each sung many of Mancini 's songs ; Mathis and Mancini collaborated on the 1986 album The Hollywood Musicals .
In 1987 he conducted an impromptu charity concert in London in aid of Children In Need .
The concert included Tchaikovsky 's 1812 Overture with firework accompaniment over the River Thames .
=== Cameos === Shortly before his death in 1994 , he made a one-off cameo appearance in the first season of the sitcom series Frasier , as a call-in patient to Dr. Frasier Crane 's radio show .
Mancini voiced the character Al , who speaks with a melancholy drawl and hates the sound of his own voice , in the episode `` Guess Who 's Coming to Breakfast ?
`` Moments after Mancini 's cameo ends , Frasier 's radio broadcast plays `` Moon River '' .
Mancini also had an uncredited performance as a pianist in the 1967 movie Gunn , the movie version of the series Peter Gunn , the score of which was composed by Mancini .
In the 1966 Pink Panther cartoon Pink , Plunk , Plink , the panther commandeered an orchestra and proceeded to conduct Mancini 's theme for the series .
At the end , the shot switched to rare live action , and Mancini was seen alone applauding in the audience .
Mancini also made a brief appearance in the title sequence of 1993 's Son of the Pink Panther , allowing the panther to conduct Bobby McFerrin in performing the film 's theme tune .
== Death and legacy == Mancini died of pancreatic cancer in Los Angeles on June 14 , 1994 .
He was working at the time on the Broadway stage version of Victor/Victoria , which he never saw on stage .
Mancini was survived by his wife of 43 years , singer Virginia `` Ginny '' O'Connor , with whom he had three children .
They had met while both were members of the Tex Beneke orchestra , just after World War II .
In 1948 , Mrs. Mancini was one of the founders of the Society of Singers , a non-profit organization which benefits the health and welfare of professional singers worldwide .
Additionally the Society awards scholarships to students pursuing an education in the vocal arts .
One of Mancini 's twin daughters , Monica Mancini , is a professional singer ; her sister Felice runs The Mr. Holland 's Opus Foundation ( MHOF ) .
His son Christopher is a music publisher and promoter in Los Angeles .
In 1996 , the Henry Mancini Institute , an academy for young music professionals , was founded by Jack Elliott in Mancini 's honor , and was later under the direction of composer-conductor Patrick Williams .
By the mid 2000s , however , the institute could not sustain itself and closed its doors on December 30 , 2006 .
However , the American Society of Composers , Authors and Publishers ( ASCAP ) Foundation `` Henry Mancini Music Scholarship '' has been awarded annually since 2001 .
While still alive , Henry created a scholarship at UCLA and the bulk of his library and works are archived in the music library at UCLA .
In 2005 , the Henry Mancini Arts Academy was opened as a division of the Lincoln Park Performing Arts Center .
The Center is located in Midland , Pennsylvania , minutes away from Mancini 's hometown of Aliquippa .
The Henry Mancini Arts Academy is an evening-and-weekend performing arts program for children from pre-K to grade 12 , with some classes also available for adults .
The program includes dance , voice , musical theater , and instrumental lessons .
The American Film Institute ranked Mancini 's songs Moon River in the No .
4 and Days of Wine and Roses in No .
39 on their list of the greatest songs and his score for The Pink Panther No .
20 on their list of the greatest film scores .
His scores for Breakfast at Tiffany 's ( 1961 ) , Charade ( 1963 ) , Hatari !
( 1962 ) , Touch of Evil ( 1958 ) and Wait Until Dark ( 1967 ) were also nominated for the list .
== Awards == Mancini was nominated for seventy-two Grammy Awards and won twenty .
He was nominated for eighteen Academy Awards and won four .
He also won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for two Emmy Awards .
In 1961 , Mancini won two Academy Awards , one for `` Moon River '' for Best Original Song and one for `` Best Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture for the movie Breakfast at Tiffany 's .
In 1962 , he won Best Original Song again , this time for `` Days of Wine and Roses '' .
He won Best Original Score again in 1982 for the movie Victor/Victoria .
On April 13 , 2004 , the United States Postal Service honored Mancini with a thirty-seven cent commemorative stamp .
The stamp was painted by artist Victor Stabin and shows Mancini conducting in front of a list of some of his most famous movie and TV themes .
== Discography == === Hit singles === === Albums === === Soundtracks === Note : Most of Mancini 's scores were not released on LP soundtrack albums .
His TV movie music albums were not soundtrack albums but are titled `` Music from ... '' or `` Music from the Motion Picture ... '' He routinely retained the rights to his music .
Mancini 's contracts allowed him to release his own albums for which he rearranged the score music into arrangements more appropriate for listening outside of the context of the film/theater .
Actual film scores using players from Hollywood unions recording under major motion picture studio contracts were expensive to release on LP ( ex : the soundtrack for 'Our Man Flint ' ( not a Mancini score ) cost $ 1 more than other LP albums of the day ) .
Many soundtrack albums used to claim `` Original Soundtrack '' or words to that effect , but were not necessarily the actual soundtrack recordings .
These albums were usually recorded with a smaller orchestra than that used for the actual scoring ( ex : Dimitri Tiomkin 's score to 'The Alamo ' ) .
However , many Hollywood musicians were featured on Mancini 's albums recorded in RCA 's Hollywood recording studios and faux `` Original Soundtrack '' albums .
Eventually some of his scores and faux `` Original Soundtrack '' scores by numerous composers were released in limited edition CDs .

Ferdinand Joseph LaMothe ( October 20 , 1890 – July 10 , 1941 ) , known professionally as Jelly Roll Morton , was an American ragtime and early jazz pianist , bandleader and composer who started his career in New Orleans , Louisiana .
Widely recognized as a pivotal figure in early jazz , Morton is perhaps most notable as jazz 's first arranger , proving that a genre rooted in improvisation could retain its essential spirit and characteristics when notated .
His composition `` Jelly Roll Blues '' , published in 1915 , was the first published jazz composition .
Morton also wrote the standards `` King Porter Stomp '' , `` Wolverine Blues '' , `` Black Bottom Stomp '' , and `` I Thought I Heard Buddy Bolden Say '' , the last a tribute to New Orleans musicians from the turn of the 20th century .
Notorious for his arrogance and self-promotion as much as he was recognized in his day for his musical talents , Morton claimed to have invented jazz outright in 1902—much to the derision of later musicians and critics .
The jazz historian , musician , and composer Gunther Schuller says of Morton 's `` hyperbolic assertions '' that there is `` no proof to the contrary '' and that Morton 's `` considerable accomplishments in themselves provide reasonable substantiation '' .
However , the scholar Katy Martin has argued that Morton 's bragging was exaggerated by Alan Lomax in his book Mister Jelly Roll , and this portrayal has influenced public opinion and scholarship on Morton since .
== Biography == === Early life === Morton was born into a creole of color family in the Faubourg Marigny neighborhood of downtown New Orleans , Louisiana .
Sources differ as to his birth date : a baptismal certificate issued in 1894 lists his date of birth as October 20 , 1890 ; Morton and his half-sisters claimed he was born on September 20 , 1885 .
His World War I draft registration card showed September 13 , 1884 , but his California death certificate listed his birth as September 20 , 1889 .
He was born to F. P. Lamothe and Louise Monette ( written as Lemott and Monett on his baptismal certificate ) .
Eulaley Haco ( Eulalie Hécaud ) was his godmother .
Hécaud helped choose his christening name , Ferdinand .
His parents lived in a common-law marriage and were not legally married .
No birth certificate has been found to date .
Ferdinand started playing music as a child , showing talent at an early age .
After his parents separated , his mother married a man named Mouton .
Ferdinand took his stepfather 's surname and anglicized it as Morton .
=== Career === At the age of fourteen , Morton began working as a piano player in a brothel ( or , as it was referred to then , a sporting house ) .
In that atmosphere , he often sang smutty lyrics ; he took the nickname `` Jelly Roll '' , which was African-American slang for female genitalia .
While working there , he was living with his churchgoing great-grandmother ; he convinced her that he worked as a night watchman in a barrel factory .
After Morton 's grandmother found out that he was playing jazz in a brothel , she kicked him out of her house .
He said : When my grandmother found out that I was playing jazz in one of the sporting houses in the District , she told me that I had disgraced the family and forbade me to live at the house .
... She told me that devil music would surely bring about my downfall , but I just could n't put it behind me .
The cornetist Rex Stewart recalled that Morton had chosen `` the nom de plume 'Morton ' to protect his family from disgrace if he was identified as a whorehouse 'professor ' .
`` Tony Jackson , also a pianist at brothels and an accomplished guitar player , was a major influence on Morton 's music .
Morton said that Jackson was the only pianist better than he was .
=== Touring === Around 1904 , Morton also started touring in the American South , working in minstrel shows including Will Benbow 's Chocolate Drops , gambling and composing .
His works `` Jelly Roll Blues '' , `` New Orleans Blues '' , `` Frog-I-More Rag '' , `` Animule Dance '' , and `` King Porter Stomp '' were composed during this period .
He got to Chicago in 1910 and New York City in 1911 , where future stride greats James P. Johnson and Willie `` The Lion '' Smith caught his act , years before the blues were widely played in the North .
In 1912–14 , Morton toured with his girlfriend Rosa Brown as a vaudeville act before settling in Chicago for three years .
By 1914 , he had started writing down his compositions .
In 1915 , his `` Jelly Roll Blues '' was arguably the first jazz composition ever published , recording as sheet music the New Orleans traditions that had been jealously guarded by musicians .
In 1917 , he followed the bandleader William Manuel Johnson and Johnson 's sister Anita Gonzalez to California , where Morton 's tango , `` The Crave '' , was a sensation in Hollywood .
=== Vancouver === Morton was invited to play a new nightclub , The Patricia , on East Hastings Street in Vancouver , British Columbia .
The jazz historian Mark Miller described his arrival as `` an extended period of itinerancy as a pianist , vaudeville performer , gambler , hustler , and , as legend would have it , pimp '' .
=== Chicago === Morton returned to Chicago in 1923 to claim authorship of his recently published rag , `` The Wolverines '' , which had become a hit as `` Wolverine Blues '' in that city .
He released the first of his commercial recordings , first as piano rolls , then on record , both as a piano soloist and with various jazz bands .
In 1926 , Morton succeeded in getting a contract to make records for the largest and most prestigious record company in the United States , the Victor Talking Machine Company .
This gave him a chance to bring a well-rehearsed band to play his arrangements in Victor 's Chicago recording studios .
These recordings , by Jelly Roll Morton & His Red Hot Peppers , are regarded as classics of 1920s jazz .
The Red Hot Peppers featured such other New Orleans jazz luminaries as Kid Ory , Omer Simeon , George Mitchell , Johnny St. Cyr , Barney Bigard , Johnny Dodds , Baby Dodds , and Andrew Hilaire .
Jelly Roll Morton & His Red Hot Peppers were one of the first acts booked on tours by MCA .
=== Marriage === In November 1928 , Morton married Mabel Bertrand , a showgirl , in Gary , Indiana .
=== New York City === They moved that year to New York City , where Morton continued to record for Victor .
His piano solos and trio recordings are well regarded , but his band recordings suffer in comparison with the Chicago sides , for which Morton could draw on many great New Orleans musicians as sidemen .
Even though Morton generally had trouble finding musicians who wanted to play his style of jazz , he recorded with such noted musicians as the clarinetists Omer Simeon , George Baquet , Albert Nicholas , Wilton Crawley , Barney Bigard , Russell Procope , Lorenzo Tio and Artie Shaw , the trumpeters Bubber Miley , Johnny Dunn and Henry `` Red '' Allen , the saxophonists Sidney Bechet , Paul Barnes and Bud Freeman , the bassist Pops Foster , and the drummers Paul Barbarin , Cozy Cole and Zutty Singleton .
His New York sessions failed to produce a hit .
With the Great Depression and the near collapse of the record industry , RCA Victor did not renew Morton 's recording contract for 1931 .
He continued playing in New York but struggled financially .
He briefly had a radio show in 1934 , then took on touring in the band of a traveling burlesque act for some steady income .
In 1935 , Morton 's 30-year-old composition `` King Porter Stomp '' , as arranged by Fletcher Henderson , became Benny Goodman 's first hit and a swing standard , but Morton received no royalties from its recordings .
=== Washington , D.C. === In 1935 , Morton moved to Washington , D.C. , to become the manager and piano player of a bar called at various times the Music Box , Blue Moon Inn , and Jungle Inn , in Shaw , an African-American neighborhood of the city .
( The building that housed the nightclub still stands , at 1211 U Street NW .
) Morton was also the master of ceremonies , bouncer , and bartender of the club .
He lived in Washington for a few years ; the club owner allowed all her friends free admission and drinks , which prevented Morton from making the business a success .
In 1938 , Morton was stabbed by a friend of the owner and suffered wounds to the head and chest .
After this incident , his wife , Mabel , demanded that they leave Washington .
During Morton 's brief residency at the Music Box , the folklorist Alan Lomax heard him playing in the bar .
In May 1938 , Lomax invited Morton to record music and interviews for the Library of Congress .
The sessions , originally intended to be a short interview with musical examples for use by music researchers in the Library of Congress , expanded to more than eight hours of Morton talking and playing piano .
Lomax also conducted longer interviews during which he took notes but did not record .
Despite the low fidelity of these noncommercial recordings , their musical and historical importance has attracted numerous jazz fans , and they have helped to ensure Morton 's place in jazz history .
Lomax was interested in Morton 's days in Storyville , in New Orleans , and the ribald songs of the time .
Although reluctant to recount and record these , Morton eventually obliged Lomax .
Because of the suggestive nature of the songs , some of the Library of Congress recordings were not released until 2005 .
In these interviews , Morton claimed to have been born in 1885 .
He was aware that if he had been born in 1890 , he would have been slightly too young to make a good case for being the inventor of jazz .
He said in an interview that Buddy Bolden played ragtime but not jazz , a view not accepted by the Bolden 's other New Orleans contemporaries .
The contradictions may stem from different definitions of the terms ragtime and jazz .
These interviews , released in different forms over the years , were released on an eight-CD boxed set in 2005 , The Complete Library of Congress Recordings .
The collection won two Grammy Awards .
The same year , Morton was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award .
=== Later years === When Morton was stabbed and wounded , a nearby whites-only hospital refused to treat him , as the city had racially segregated facilities .
He was transported to a black hospital farther away .
When he was in the hospital , the doctors left ice on his wounds for several hours before attending to his eventually fatal injury .
His recovery from his wounds was incomplete , and thereafter he was often ill and easily became short of breath .
Morton made a new series of commercial recordings in New York , several reprising tunes from his early years that he discussed in his Library of Congress interviews .
Worsening asthma sent him to a New York hospital for three months at one point .
He continued to suffer from respiratory problems when visiting Los Angeles with a series of manuscripts of new tunes and arrangements , planning to form a new band and restart his career .
Morton died on July 10 , 1941 , after an eleven-day stay in Los Angeles County General Hospital .
According to the jazz historian David Gelly in 2000 , Morton 's arrogance and `` bumptious '' persona alienated so many musicians over the years that no colleagues or admirers attended his funeral .
However , a contemporary news account of the funeral in the August 1 , 1941 , issue of Downbeat magazine reported that the musicians Kid Ory , Mutt Carey , Fred Washington and Ed Garland were among his pallbearers , noting the absence of Duke Ellington and Jimmie Lunceford , both of whom were appearing in Los Angeles at the time .
( The article is reproduced in Alan Lomax 's biography of Morton , Mister Jelly Roll , University of California Press , 1950 .
) == Piano style == Morton 's piano style was formed from early secondary ragtime and `` shout '' , which also evolved separately into the New York school of stride piano .
Morton 's playing was also close to barrelhouse , which produced boogie-woogie .
Morton often played the melody of a tune with his right thumb , while sounding a harmony above these notes with other fingers of the right hand .
This added a rustic or `` out-of-tune '' sound ( due to the playing of a diminished 5th above the melody ) .
This may still be recognized as belonging to New Orleans .
Morton also walked in major and minor sixths in the bass , instead of tenths or octaves .
He played basic swing rhythms with both the left and the right hand .
== Compositions == The folllowing list is a selection of Morton 's compositions , listed alphabetically .
Several of Morton 's compositions were musical tributes to himself , including `` Winin ' Boy '' , `` The Jelly Roll Blues '' ( subtitled `` The Original Jelly-Roll '' ) ; and `` Mr. Jelly Lord '' .
In the big-band era , his `` King Porter Stomp '' , which Morton had written decades earlier , was a big hit for Fletcher Henderson and Benny Goodman ; it became a standard covered by most other swing bands of that time .
Morton claimed to have written some tunes that were copyrighted by others , including `` Alabama Bound '' and `` Tiger Rag '' .
`` Sweet Peter '' , which Morton recorded in 1926 , appears to be the source of the melody of the hit song `` All of Me , '' which was credited to Gerald Marks and Seymour Simons in 1931 .
His musical influence continues in the work of Dick Hyman , David Thomas Roberts , and Reginald Robinson .
=== Albums === The Piano Rolls ( Nonesuch , 1997 ) Giants of Jazz ( Collectables , 1998 ) Mr. Jelly Roll ( Tomato Music , 2003 ) == Legacy == Morton was inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and was elected as a charter member of the Gennett Records Walk of Fame .
He was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in 2008 .
== Representation in other media == Two Broadway shows have featured his music : Jelly Roll and Jelly 's Last Jam .
The first draws heavily on Morton 's own words and stories from the Library of Congress interviews .
Morton appears as the piano `` professor '' in Louis Malle 's Pretty Baby , where he is portrayed by the actor Antonio Fargas , with piano and vocals by James Booker .
Jelly Roll Morton 's Last Night at the Jungle Inn : An Imaginary Memoir ( 1984 ) , by the ethnomusicologist and folklorist Samuel Charters , embellishing Morton 's early stories about his life .
Morton and his godmother , who went by the name Eulalie Echo , appear as characters in David Fulmer 's mystery novel Chasing the Devil 's Tail .
Morton is featured in Alessandro Baricco 's book Novecento .
He is the `` inventor of jazz '' and the protagonist 's rival throughout the book .
This book was adapted as a movie , The Legend of 1900 , directed by Giuseppe Tornatore , in which Morton is played by Clarence Williams III .
The play Do n't You Leave Me Here , by Clare Brown , which premiered at West Yorkshire Playhouse on 27 September 2008 , deals with Morton 's relationship with the musician Tony Jackson .
Morton is mentioned in `` Cornet Man '' , sung by Barbra Streisand in the Broadway musical Funny Girl ( 1964 ) .
The fictional attorney Perry Mason is a fan of jazz , including music by Morton ( The Case of the Missing Melody ) .

She was one of the first major artists to record the songs of Bob Dylan in the early 1960s ; Baez was already an internationally celebrated artist and did much to popularize his early songwriting efforts .
Baez also performed three songs at the 1969 Woodstock Festival and has displayed a lifelong commitment to political and social activism in the fields of nonviolence , civil rights , human rights and the environment .
Baez was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 7 , 2017 .
== Early life == Baez was born on Staten Island , New York , on January 9 , 1941 .
Joan 's grandfather , the Reverend Alberto Baez , left Catholicism to become a Methodist minister and moved to the U.S. when her father was two years old .
Her father , Albert Baez ( 1912–2007 ) , was born in Puebla , Mexico and grew up in Brooklyn , New York , where his father preached to—and advocated for—a Spanish-speaking congregation .
Albert first considered becoming a minister but instead turned to the study of mathematics and physics and received his Ph.D. degree at Stanford University in 1950 .
Albert was later credited as a co-inventor of the x-ray microscope .
Joan 's cousin , John C. Baez , is a mathematical physicist , whom Albert interested in physics as a child .
Her mother , Joan Baez ( née Bridge ) , referred to as Joan Senior or `` Big Joan '' , was born in Edinburgh , Scotland in 1913 as the second daughter of an English Anglican priest who claimed to be descended from the Dukes of Chandos .
Born in April 1913 , she died on April 20 , 2013 , days after her one hundredth birthday .
Baez had two sisters — the elder , Pauline Thalia Baez Bryan ( 1938–2016 ) , and the younger , Mimi Fariña ( 1945–2001 ) .
Mimi , also a musician and activist , died of cancer in California in 2001 .
The Baez family converted to Quakerism during Joan 's early childhood , and she has continued to identify with the tradition , particularly in her commitment to pacifism and social issues .
While growing up , Baez was subjected to racial slurs and discrimination due to her Mexican heritage .
Consequently , she became involved with a variety of social causes early in her career .
She declined to play in any white student venues that were segregated , which meant that when she toured the Southern states she would play only at black colleges .
Joan graduated from Palo Alto High School in 1958 .
Due to her father 's work in health care and with UNESCO , their family moved many times , living in towns across the U.S , as well as in England , France , Switzerland , Spain , Canada , and the Middle East , including Iraq .
Joan Baez became involved with a variety of social causes early in her career , including civil rights and non-violence .
Social justice , she stated in the PBS series American Masters , is the true core of her life , `` looming larger than music '' .
== Music career == The opening line of Baez 's memoir And a Voice to Sing With is `` I was born gifted '' ( referencing her singing voice , which she explained was given to her and for which she can take no credit ) .
A friend of Joan 's father gave her a ukulele .
She learned four chords , which enabled her to play rhythm and blues , the music she was listening to at the time .
Her parents , however , were fearful that the music would lead her into a life of drug addiction .
When Baez was 13 , her aunt and her aunt 's boyfriend took her to a concert by folk musician Pete Seeger , and Baez found herself strongly moved by his music .
She soon began practicing the songs of his repertoire and performing them publicly .
One of her very earliest public performances was at a retreat in Saratoga , California for a youth group from Temple Beth Jacob , a Redwood City , California Jewish congregation .
A few years later in 1957 , Baez bought her first Gibson acoustic guitar .
=== College music scene in Massachusetts === In 1958 , her father accepted a faculty position at MIT , and moved his family to Massachusetts .
At that time , it was in the center of the up-and-coming folk-music scene , and Baez began performing near home in Boston and nearby Cambridge .
She also performed in clubs , and attended Boston University for about six weeks .
In 1958 , at the Club 47 in Cambridge , she gave her first concert .
When designing the poster for the performance , Baez considered changing her performing name to either Rachel Sandperl , the surname of her long-time mentor , Ira Sandperl , or Maria from the song `` They Call the Wind Maria '' .
She later opted against doing so , fearing that people would accuse her of changing her last name because it was Spanish .
The audience consisted of her parents , her sister Mimi , her boyfriend , and a few friends , resulting in a total of eight patrons .
She was paid ten dollars .
Baez was later asked back and began performing twice a week for $ 25 per show .
A few months later , Baez and two other folk enthusiasts made plans to record an album in the cellar of a friend 's house .
The three sang solos and duets , a family friend designed the album cover , and it was released on Veritas Records that same year as Folksingers 'Round Harvard Square .
Baez later met Bob Gibson and Odetta , who were at the time two of the most prominent vocalists singing folk and gospel music .
Baez cites Odetta as a primary influence along with Marian Anderson and Pete Seeger .
Gibson invited Baez to perform with him at the 1959 Newport Folk Festival , where the two sang two duets , `` Virgin Mary Had One Son '' and `` We Are Crossing Jordan River '' .
The performance generated substantial praise for the `` barefoot Madonna '' with the otherworldly voice , and it was this appearance that led to Baez signing with Vanguard Records the following year although Columbia Records tried to sign her first .
Baez later claimed that she felt she would be given more artistic license at a more `` low key '' label .
Baez 's nickname at the time , `` Madonna '' , has been attributed to her clear voice , long hair , and natural beauty , and to her role as `` Earth Mother '' .
=== First albums and 1960s breakthrough === Her true professional career began at the 1959 Newport Folk Festival .
Following that appearance , she recorded her first album for Vanguard , Joan Baez ( 1960 ) , produced by Fred Hellerman of The Weavers , who produced many albums by folk artists .
The collection of traditional folk ballads , blues , and laments sung to her own guitar accompaniment sold moderately well .
It featured many popular Child Ballads of the day and was recorded in only four days in the ballroom of New York City 's Manhattan Towers Hotel .
The album also included `` El Preso Numero Nueve '' , a song sung entirely in Spanish .
( She would rerecord the later song in 1974 for inclusion on her Spanish-language album , Gracias a la Vida ) On November 11 , 1961 , Baez played her first major New York concert at a sold-out performance at Town Hall .
Robert Shelton , folk critic of the New York Times , praised the concert , saying , `` That superb soprano voice , as lustrous and rich as old gold , flowed purely all evening with a wondrous ease .
Her singing ( unwound ) like a spool of satin .
`` ( Stu Steadman , `` This Day in Rock , '' retrieved from www.thisdayinrock.com ) Years later when Baez thought back to that concert , she laughed , saying : `` I remember in 1961 my manager sending me this newspaper ( clipping ) in the mail ( which ) read , 'Joan Baez Town Hall Concert , SRO .
' I thought SRO meant 'sold right out .
' I was so innocent of it all .
`` ( David A. Maurer , `` Joan Baez : Folk Singer , Hereditary Activist , '' `` The Daily Progress , '' March 10 , 2016 ) Her second release , Joan Baez , Vol .
2 ( 1961 ) , went `` gold '' , as did Joan Baez in Concert , Part 1 ( 1962 ) and Joan Baez in Concert , Part 2 ( 1963 ) .
Like its immediate predecessor , Joan Baez , Vol .
2 contained strictly traditional material .
Her two albums of live material , Joan Baez in Concert , Part 1 and its second counterpart , were unique in that unlike most live albums they contained only new songs rather than established favorites .
It was Joan Baez in Concert , Part 2 that featured Baez 's first-ever Dylan cover .
From the early-to-mid-1960s , Baez emerged at the forefront of the American roots revival , where she introduced her audiences to the then-unknown Bob Dylan , and was emulated by artists such as Judy Collins , Emmylou Harris , Joni Mitchell , and Bonnie Raitt .
On November 23 , 1962 , Baez appeared on the cover of Time Magazine—a rare honor then for a musician .
Though primarily an album artist , several of Baez ' singles have charted , the first being her 1965 cover of Phil Ochs ' `` There but for Fortune '' , which became a mid-level chart hit in the U.S. and a top-ten single in the United Kingdom .
Baez added other instruments to her recordings on Farewell , Angelina ( 1965 ) , which features several Dylan songs interspersed with more traditional fare .
Deciding to experiment with different styles , Baez turned to Peter Schickele , a classical music composer , who provided classical orchestration for her next three albums : Noël ( 1966 ) , Joan ( 1967 ) , and Baptism : A Journey Through Our Time ( 1968 ) .
Noël was a Christmas album of traditional material , while Baptism was akin to a concept album , featuring Baez reading and singing poems written by celebrated poets such as James Joyce , Federico García Lorca , and Walt Whitman .
Joan featured interpretations of work by then-contemporary composers , including John Lennon and Paul McCartney , Tim Hardin , Paul Simon , and Donovan .
In 1968 , Baez traveled to Nashville , Tennessee , where a marathon recording session resulted in two albums .
The first , Any Day Now ( 1968 ) , consists exclusively of Dylan covers .
The other , the country-music-infused David 's Album ( 1969 ) , was recorded for then-husband David Harris , a prominent anti-Vietnam War protester eventually imprisoned for draft resistance .
Harris , a country-music fan , turned Baez toward more complex country-rock influences beginning with David 's Album .
Later in 1968 , she published her first memoir , Daybreak ( by Dial Press ) .
In 1969 , her appearance at Woodstock in upstate New York afforded her an international musical and political podium , particularly upon the successful release of the documentary film Woodstock ( 1970 ) .
Beginning in the late 1960s , Baez began writing many of her own songs , beginning with `` Sweet Sir Galahad '' and `` A Song For David , '' both songs appearing on her 1970 ( I Live ) One Day at a Time album ; `` Sweet Sir Galahad '' was written about her sister Mimi 's second marriage while `` A Song For David '' was a tribute to Harris .
One Day at a Time , like David 's Album , featured a decidedly country sound .
Baez 's distinctive vocal style and political activism had a significant impact on popular music .
She was one of the first musicians to use her popularity as a vehicle for social protest , singing and marching for human rights and peace .
Pete Seeger , Odetta , and decades-long friend Harry Belafonte were her early social justice advocate influences .
Baez came to be considered the `` most accomplished interpretive folksinger/songwriter of the 1960s '' .
Her appeal extended far beyond the folk-music audience .
Of her fourteen Vanguard albums , thirteen made the top 100 of Billboard 's mainstream pop chart , eleven made the top forty , eight made the top twenty , and four made the top ten .
=== 1970s and the end of Vanguard years === After eleven years with Vanguard , Baez decided in 1971 to cut ties with the label that had released her albums since 1960 .
She delivered them one last success with the gold-selling album Blessed Are ... ( 1971 ) which included a top-ten hit in `` The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down '' , her cover of The Band 's signature song .
With Come from the Shadows ( 1972 ) , Baez switched to A & M Records , where she remained for four years and six albums .
Joan Baez wrote `` The Story of Bangladesh '' in 1971 .
This song was based on the Pakistani army crackdown on unarmed sleeping Bengali students at Dhaka University on March 25 , 1971 , which ignited the prolonged nine-month Bangladesh Liberation War .
The song was later entitled `` The Song of Bangladesh '' and released in a 1972 album from Chandos Music .
During this period in late 1971 , she reunited with composer Peter Schickele to record two tracks , `` Rejoice in the Sun '' and `` Silent Running '' for the science-fiction film , Silent Running .
The two songs were issued as a single on Decca ( 32890 ) .
In addition to this , another LP was released on Decca ( DL 7-9188 ) and was later reissued by Varèse Sarabande on black ( STV-81072 ) and green ( VC-81072 ) vinyl .
In 1998 a limited release on CD by the `` Valley Forge Record Groupe '' was released .
Baez 's first album for A & M , Come from the Shadows , was recorded in Nashville , and included a number of more personal compositions , including `` Love Song to a Stranger '' and `` Myths '' , as well as work by Mimi Farina , John Lennon , and Anna Marly .
Where Are You Now , My Son ?
( 1973 ) featured a 23-minute title song which took up all of the B-side of the album .
Half spoken word poem and half tape-recorded sounds , the song documented Baez 's visit to Hanoi , North Vietnam , in December 1972 during which she and her traveling companions survived the 11-day-long Christmas Bombings campaign over Hanoi and Haiphong .
( See Vietnam War in Civil rights section below .
) Gracias a la Vida ( 1974 ) ( the title song written and first performed by Chilean folk singer Violeta Parra ) followed and was a success in both the U.S. and Latin America .
It included the song `` Cucurrucucú paloma '' .
Flirting with mainstream pop music as well as writing her own songs for Diamonds & Rust ( 1975 ) , the album became the highest selling of Baez 's career and included a second top-ten single in the form of the title track .
After Gulf Winds ( 1976 ) , an album of entirely self-composed songs and From Every Stage ( 1976 ) , a live album that had Baez performing songs `` from every stage '' of her career , Baez again parted ways with a record label when she moved to CBS Records for Blowin ' Away ( 1977 ) and Honest Lullaby ( 1979 ) .
=== 1980s and 1990s === In 1980 , Baez was given honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degrees by Antioch University and Rutgers University for her political activism and the `` universality of her music '' .
In 1983 , she appeared on the Grammy Awards , performing Dylan 's anthemic `` Blowin ' in the Wind '' , a song she first performed twenty years earlier .
Baez also played a significant role in the 1985 Live Aid concert for African famine relief , opening the U.S. segment of the show in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .
She has toured on behalf of many other causes , including Amnesty International 's 1986 A Conspiracy of Hope tour and a guest spot on their subsequent Human Rights Now !
tour .
Baez found herself without an American label for the release of Live Europe 83 ( 1984 ) , which was released in Europe and Canada but not released commercially in the U.S. She did not have an American release until the album Recently ( 1987 ) on Gold Castle Records .
In 1987 , Baez 's second autobiography called And a Voice to Sing With was published and became a New York Times bestseller .
That same year , she traveled to the Middle East to visit with and sing songs of peace for Israel and the Palestinians .
In May 1989 , Baez performed at a music festival in communist Czechoslovakia called Bratislavská lýra .
While there , she met future Czechoslovakian president Václav Havel , whom she let carry her guitar so as to prevent his arrest by government agents .
During her performance , she greeted members of Charter 77 , a dissident human-rights group , which resulted in her microphone being shut off abruptly .
Baez then proceeded to sing a cappella for the nearly four thousand gathered .
Havel cited her as a great inspiration and influence in that country 's Velvet Revolution , the revolution in which the Soviet-dominated communist government there was overthrown .
Baez recorded two more albums with Gold Castle , Speaking of Dreams , ( 1989 ) and Brothers in Arms ( 1991 ) .
She then landed a contract with a major label , Virgin Records , recording Play Me Backwards ( 1992 ) for Virgin shortly before the company was purchased by EMI .
She then switched to Guardian , with whom she produced a live album , Ring Them Bells ( 1995 ) , and a studio album , Gone from Danger ( 1997 ) .
In 1993 , at the invitation of Refugees International and sponsored by the Soros Foundation , she traveled to the war-torn Bosnia and Herzegovina region of former-Yugoslavia in an effort to help bring more attention to the suffering there .
She was the first major artist to perform in Sarajevo since the outbreak of the Yugoslav civil war .
In October of that year , Baez became the first major artist to perform in a professional concert presentation on Alcatraz Island ( a former U.S. federal prison ) in San Francisco , California in a benefit for her sister Mimi 's Bread and Roses organization .
She later returned for another concert in 1996 .
=== 2000s === Beginning in 2001 , Baez has had several successful long-term engagements as a lead character at San Francisco 's Teatro ZinZanni .
In August 2001 , Vanguard began re-releasing Baez 's first 13 albums , which she recorded for the label between 1960 and 1971 .
The reissues , being released through Vanguard 's Original Master Series , feature digitally restored sound , unreleased bonus songs , new and original artwork , and new liner-note essays written by Arthur Levy .
Likewise , her six A & M albums were reissued in 2003 .
In 2003 , Baez was also a judge for the third annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists ' careers .
Her album , Dark Chords on a Big Guitar ( 2003 ) , features songs by composers half her age , while a November 2004 performance at New York City 's Bowery Ballroom was recorded for a live release , Bowery Songs ( 2005 ) .
On October 1 , 2005 , she performed at the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass festival , at San Francisco 's Golden Gate Park .

On June 6 , 2006 , Baez joined Bruce Springsteen on stage at his San Francisco concert , where the two performed the rolling anthem `` Pay Me My Money Down '' .
In September 2006 , Baez contributed a live , retooled version of her classic song `` Sweet Sir Galahad '' to a Starbucks 's exclusive XM Artist Confidential album .
In the new version , she changed the lyric `` here 's to the dawn of their days '' to `` here 's to the dawn of her days '' , as a tribute to her late sister Mimi , about whom Baez wrote the song in 1969 .
Later on , October 8 , 2006 , she appeared as a special surprise guest at the opening ceremony of the Forum 2000 international conference in Prague , Czech Republic .
Her performance was kept secret from former Czech Republic President Havel until the moment she appeared on stage .
Havel was a great admirer of both Baez and her work .
During Baez 's next visit to Prague , in April 2007 , the two met again when she performed in front of a sold-out house at Prague 's Lucerna Hall , a building erected by Havel 's grandfather .
On December 2 , 2006 , she made a guest appearance at the Oakland Interfaith Gospel Choir 's Christmas Concert at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland , California .
Her participation included versions of `` Let Us Break Bread Together '' and `` Amazing Grace '' .
She also joined the choir in the finale of `` O Holy Night '' .
In February 2007 , Proper Records reissued her live album Ring Them Bells ( 1995 ) , which featured duets with artists ranging from Dar Williams and Mimi Fariña to the Indigo Girls and Mary Chapin Carpenter .
The reissue features a 16-page booklet and six unreleased live tracks from the original recording sessions , including `` Love Song to a Stranger '' , `` You Ai n't Goin ' Nowhere '' , `` Geordie '' , `` Gracias a la Vida '' , `` The Water Is Wide '' and `` Stones in the Road '' , bringing the total track listing to 21 songs ( on two discs ) .
In addition , Baez recorded a duet of `` Jim Crow '' with John Mellencamp which appears on his album Freedom 's Road ( 2007 ) .
He has called the album a `` Woody Guthrie rock album '' .
The recording was heavily influenced by albums from the 1960s , which is why he invited an icon from that era to appear with him .
Also in February 2007 , she received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award .
The day after receiving the honor , she appeared at the Grammy Awards ceremony and introduced a performance by the Dixie Chicks .
September 9 , 2008 , saw the release of the studio album Day After Tomorrow , produced by Steve Earle and featuring three of his songs .

`` ( Anthony Mason Interview , `` Her Honor .
Joan Baez On Her Career .
Rock & Roll Induction , '' `` CBS Sunday Morning , '' April 9 , 2017 ) On 28 June 2017 , Baez announced a ten-show residency from 4 to 17 June 2018 at L'Olympia in Paris , France , as the beginning of her Fare Thee Well ... Tour 2018 .
== Social and political involvement == To reward her decades of dedicated activism , Baez was honoured with the Spirit of Americana/Free Speech award at the 2008 Americana Music Honors & Awards .
=== 1950s === In 1956 , Baez first heard Martin Luther King , Jr. speak about nonviolence , civil rights and social change which brought tears to her eyes .
Several years later , the two became friends , with Baez participating in many of the Civil Rights Movement demonstrations that Dr. King helped organize .
In 1958 , at age 17 , Baez committed her first act of civil disobedience as a conscientious objector by refusing to leave her Palo Alto High School classroom in Palo Alto , California for an air-raid drill .
=== Civil rights === The early years of Baez 's career saw the Civil Rights Movement in the U.S. become a prominent issue .
Her performance of `` We Shall Overcome '' , the civil rights anthem written by Pete Seeger and Guy Carawan , at the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom permanently linked her to the song .
Baez again sang `` We Shall Overcome '' in Sproul Plaza during the mid-1960s Free Speech Movement demonstrations at the University of California , Berkeley in Berkeley , California , and at many other rallies and protests .
Her recording of the song `` Birmingham Sunday '' ( 1964 ) , written by her brother-in-law , Richard Fariña , was used in the opening of 4 Little Girls ( 1997 ) , Spike Lee 's documentary film about the four young victims killed in the 1963 16th Street Baptist Church bombing .
In 1965 , Baez announced that she would be opening a school to teach nonviolent protest .
She also participated in the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches for voting rights .
=== Vietnam War === Highly visible in civil-rights marches , Baez became more vocal about her disagreement with the Vietnam War .
In 1964 , she publicly endorsed resisting taxes by withholding sixty percent of her 1963 income taxes .
In 1964 , she founded the Institute for the Study of Nonviolence ( along with her mentor Sandperl ) and encouraged draft resistance at her concerts .
The Institute for the Study of Nonviolence would later branch into the Resource Center for Nonviolence .
In 1966 , Baez 's autobiography , Daybreak , was released .
It is the most detailed report of her life through 1966 and outlined her anti-war position , dedicating the book to men facing imprisonment for resisting the draft .
Baez was arrested twice in 1967 for blocking the entrance of the Armed Forces Induction Center in Oakland , California , and spent over a month in jail .
( See also David Harris section below .
) She was a frequent participant in anti-war marches and rallies , including : numerous protests in New York City organized by the Fifth Avenue Vietnam Peace Parade Committee , starting with the March 1966 Fifth Avenue Peace Parade , a free 1967 concert at the Washington Monument in Washington , D.C. , that had been opposed by the Daughters of the American Revolution which attracted a crowd of 30,000 to hear her anti-war message , the 1969 Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam protests .
There were many others , culminating in Phil Ochs 's The War Is Over celebration in New York City in May 1975 .
During the Christmas season 1972 , Baez joined a peace delegation traveling to North Vietnam , both to address human rights in the region , and to deliver Christmas mail to American prisoners of war .
During her time there , she was caught in the U.S. military 's `` Christmas bombing '' of Hanoi , North Vietnam , during which the city was bombed for eleven straight days .
Her disquiet at the human-rights violations of communist Vietnam made her increasingly critical of its government and she organized the May 30 , 1979 , publication of a full-page advertisement ( published in four major U.S. newspapers ) in which the communists were described as having created a nightmare .
=== Human rights === Baez was instrumental in founding the USA section of Amnesty International in the 1970s , and has remained an active supporter of the organization .
Baez 's experiences regarding Vietnam 's human-rights violations ultimately led her to found her own human-rights group in the late 1970s , Humanitas International , whose focus was to target oppression wherever it occurred , criticizing right and left-wing régimes equally .
In 1976 , she was awarded the Thomas Merton Award for her ongoing activism .
She toured Chile , Brazil and Argentina in 1981 , but was prevented from performing in any of the three countries , for fear her criticism of their human-rights practices would reach mass audiences if she were given a podium .
While there , she was kept under surveillance and subjected to death threats .
A film of the ill-fated tour , There but for Fortune , was shown on PBS in 1982 .
In 1989 , after the Tiananmen Massacre in Beijing , Baez wrote and released the song `` China '' to condemn the Chinese government for its violent and bloody crackdown on thousands of student protesters who called for establishment of democratic republicanism .
In a second trip to Southeast Asia , Baez assisted in an effort to take food and medicine into the western regions of Cambodia , and participated in a United Nations Humanitarian Conference on Kampuchea .
On July 17 , 2006 , Baez received the Distinguished Leadership Award from the Legal Community Against Violence .
At the annual dinner event , they honored her for her lifetime of work against violence of all kinds .
In 2015 , Baez received the Ambassador of Conscience Award .
In 2016 , Baez advocated for the Innocence Project and Innocence Network .
At each concert , Baez informs the audience about the organizations ' efforts to exhonerate the wrongfully convicted and reform the system to prevent such incidents .
==== Opposing the death penalty ==== In December 2005 , Baez appeared and sang `` Swing Low , Sweet Chariot '' at the California protest at the San Quentin State Prison against the execution of Tookie Williams .
She had previously performed the same song at San Quentin at the 1992 vigil protesting the execution of Robert Alton Harris , the first man to be executed in California after the death penalty was reinstated .
She subsequently lent her prestige to the campaign opposing the execution of Troy Davis by the State of Georgia .
==== LGBT rights ==== Baez has also been prominent in the struggle for gay and lesbian rights .
In 1978 , she performed at several benefit concerts to defeat the Briggs Initiative , which proposed banning all gay people from teaching in the public schools of California .
Later that same year , she participated in memorial marches for the assassinated San Francisco city supervisor , Harvey Milk , who was openly gay .
In the 1990s , she appeared with her friend Janis Ian at a benefit for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force , a gay lobbying organization , and performed at the San Francisco Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual and Transgender Pride March .
Her song `` Altar Boy and the Thief '' from Blowin ' Away ( 1977 ) was written as a dedication to her gay fanbase .
==== Iran ==== On June 25 , 2009 , Baez created a special version of `` We Shall Overcome '' with a few lines of Persian lyrics in support of peaceful protests by Iranian people .
She recorded it in her home and posted the video on YouTube and on her personal website .
She dedicated the song `` Joe Hill '' , to the people of Iran during her concert at Merrill Auditorium , Portland , Maine on July 31 , 2009 .
=== Environmental causes === On Earth Day 1999 , Baez and Bonnie Raitt honored environmental activist Julia Butterfly Hill with Raitt 's Arthur M. Sohcot Award in person on her 180-foot ( 55 m ) -high redwood treetop platform , where Hill had camped to protect ancient redwoods in the Headwaters Forest from logging .
=== War in Iraq === In early 2003 , Baez performed at two rallies of hundreds of thousands of people in San Francisco protesting the U.S. invasion of Iraq ( as she had earlier done before smaller crowds in 1991 to protest the Gulf War ) .
In August 2003 , she was invited by Emmylou Harris and Steve Earle to join them in London , UK , at the Concert For a Landmine-Free World .
In the summer of 2004 , Baez joined Michael Moore 's `` Slacker Uprising Tour '' on American college campuses , encouraging young people to get out and vote for peace candidates in the upcoming national election .
In August 2005 , Baez appeared at the Texas anti-war protest that had been started by Cindy Sheehan .
== Tree sit in == On May 23 , 2006 , Baez once again joined Julia `` Butterfly '' Hill , this time in a `` tree sit '' in a giant tree on the site of the South Central Farm in a poor neighborhood of downtown Los Angeles , California .
Baez and Hill were hoisted into the tree , where they remained overnight .
The women , in addition to many other activists and celebrities , were protesting the imminent eviction of the community farmers and demolition of the site , which is the largest urban farm in the state .
Because many of the South Central Farmers are immigrants from Central America , Baez sang several songs from her 1974 Spanish-language album , Gracias a la Vida , including the title track and `` No Nos Moverán '' ( `` We Shall Not Be Moved '' ) .
=== 2008 presidential election === Throughout most of her career , Baez remained apprehensive about involving herself in party politics .
However , on February 3 , 2008 , Baez wrote a letter to the editor at the San Francisco Chronicle endorsing Barack Obama in the 2008 U.S. presidential election .
She noted : `` Through all those years , I chose not to engage in party politics ... . At this time , however , changing that posture feels like the responsible thing to do .
If anyone can navigate the contaminated waters of Washington , lift up the poor , and appeal to the rich to share their wealth , it is Sen. Barack Obama .
`` Playing at the Glastonbury Festival in June , Baez said during the introduction of a song that one reason she likes Obama is because he reminds her of another old friend of hers : Martin Luther King , Jr .
Although a highly political figure throughout most of her career , Baez had never publicly endorsed a major political party candidate prior to Obama .
However , after Obama was elected , she expressed that she would likely never do so again , saying in a 2013 interview in The Huffington Post that `` In some ways I 'm disappointed , but in some ways it was silly to expect more .
If he had taken his brilliance , his eloquence , his toughness and not run for office he could have led a movement .
Once he got in the Oval Office he could n't do anything. '' .
She performed at the White House on February 10 , 2010 , as part of an evening celebrating the music associated with the civil rights movement , performing `` We Shall Overcome '' .
=== Joan Baez Award === On March 18 , 2011 , Baez was honored by Amnesty International at its 50th Anniversary Annual General Meeting in San Francisco .
The tribute to Baez was the inaugural event for the Amnesty International Joan Baez Award for Outstanding Inspirational Service in the Global Fight for Human Rights .
Baez was presented with the first award in recognition of her human rights work with Amnesty International and beyond , and the inspiration she has given activists around the world .
In future years , the award is to be presented to an artist — music , film , sculpture , paint or other medium — who has similarly helped advance human rights .
=== Occupy Wall Street === On November 11 , 2011 , Baez played as part of a musical concert for the protestors at Occupy Wall Street .
Her three-song set included `` Joe Hill '' , a cover of the Rolling Stones ' `` Salt of the Earth '' and her own composition `` Where 's My Apple Pie ?
`` == Personal life == === Early relationships === Baez 's first real boyfriend was Michael New , a young man whom she met at her college .
Years later in 1979 , he inspired her song `` Michael '' .
New was a fellow student from Trinidad who , like Baez , attended classes only occasionally .
The two spent a considerable amount of time together , but Baez was unable to balance her blossoming career and her relationship .
The two bickered and made up repeatedly , but it was apparent to Baez that New was beginning to resent her success and new-found local celebrity .
One night she saw him kissing another woman on a street corner .
Despite this , the relationship remained intact for several years , long after the two moved to California together in 1960 .
=== Bob Dylan === Baez first met Dylan in 1961 at Gerde 's Folk City in New York City 's Greenwich Village .
At the time , Baez had already released her debut album and her popularity as the emerging `` Queen of Folk '' was on the rise .
Baez was initially unimpressed with the `` urban hillbilly '' , but was impressed with one of Dylan 's first compositions , `` Song to Woody '' and remarked that she would like to record it .
At the start , Dylan was more interested in Baez 's younger sister Mimi , but under the glare of media scrutiny that began to surround Baez and Dylan , their relationship began to develop into something more .
By 1963 , Baez had already released three albums , two of which had been certified gold , and she invited Dylan on stage to perform alongside her at the Newport Folk Festival .
The two performed the Dylan composition `` With God on Our Side '' , a performance that set the stage for many more duets like it in the months and years to come .
Typically while on tour , Baez would invite Dylan to sing on stage partly by himself and partly with her , much to the chagrin of her fans .
Before meeting Dylan , Baez 's topical songs were very few : `` Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream '' , `` We Shall Overcome '' , and an assortment of Negro spirituals .
Baez would later say that Dylan 's songs seemed to update the topics of protest and justice .
By the time of Dylan 's 1965 tour of the U.K. , their relationship had slowly begun to fizzle out after they had been romantically involved off and on for nearly two years .
The tour and simultaneous disintegration of their relationship was documented in D. A. Pennebaker 's documentary film Dont Look Back ( 1967 ) .
Baez toured with Dylan as a performer on his Rolling Thunder Revue in 1975–76 .
She sang four songs with Dylan on the live album of the tour , The Bootleg Series Vol .
5 : Bob Dylan Live 1975 , The Rolling Thunder Revue , released in 2002 .
Baez appeared with Dylan in the one-hour TV special Hard Rain , filmed at Fort Collins , Colorado , in May 1976 .
Baez also starred as 'The Woman In White ' in the film Renaldo and Clara ( 1978 ) , directed by Bob Dylan and filmed during the Rolling Thunder Revue .
Dylan and Baez toured together again in 1984 along with Carlos Santana .
Baez discussed her relationship with Dylan in Martin Scorsese 's documentary film No Direction Home ( 2005 ) , and in the PBS American Masters biography of Baez , How Sweet the Sound ( 2009 ) .
Baez wrote and composed at least three songs that were specifically about Dylan .
In `` To Bobby '' , written in 1972 , she urged Dylan to return to political activism , while in `` Diamonds & Rust '' , the title track from her 1975 album , she revisited her feelings for him in warm , yet direct terms .
`` Winds of the Old Days '' , also on the Diamonds & Rust album , is a bittersweet reminiscence about her time with `` Bobby '' .
The references to Baez in Dylan 's songs are far less clear .
Baez herself has suggested that she was the subject of both `` Visions of Johanna '' and `` Mama , You Been on My Mind '' , although the latter was more likely about his relationship with Suze Rotolo .
Baez implied when speaking about the connection to Diamonds and Rust that `` Lily , Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts '' is , at least in part , a metaphor for Dylan 's view of his relationship with her .
As for `` Visions of Johanna '' , `` She Belongs to Me '' , and other songs alleged to have been written about Baez , neither Dylan nor biographers such as Clinton Heylin and Michael Gray have had anything definitive to say , either way , regarding the subject of these songs .
=== David Harris === In October 1967 , Baez and her mother , along with nearly 70 other women , were arrested at the Oakland , California , Armed Forces Induction Center for blocking its doorways to prevent entrance by young inductees , and in support of young men who refused military induction .
They were incarcerated in the Santa Rita Jail , and it was here that Baez met David Harris , who was kept on the men 's side but who still managed to visit with Baez regularly .
The two formed a close bond upon their release and Baez moved into his draft-resistance commune in the hills above Stanford , California .
The pair had known each other for three months when they decided to wed. After confirming the news to Associated Press , media outlets began dedicating ample press to the impending nuptials ( at one point , Time magazine referred to the event as the `` Wedding of the Century '' ) .
After finding a pacifist preacher and a church outfitted with peace signs and writing a blend of Episcopalian and Quaker wedding vows , Baez and Harris married in New York City on March 26 , 1968 .
Her friend Judy Collins sang at the ceremony .
After the wedding , Baez and Harris moved into a home in the Los Altos Hills on 10 acres ( 4.0 hectares ) of land called Struggle Mountain , part of a commune , where they tended gardens and were strict vegetarians .
A short time later , Harris refused induction into the armed forces and was indicted .
On July 16 , 1969 , Harris was taken by federal marshals to prison .
Baez was visibly pregnant in public in the months that followed , most notably at the Woodstock Festival , where she performed a handful of songs in the early morning .
The documentary film Carry It On was produced during this period , and was released in 1970 .
The film 's behind-the-scenes looks at Harris 's views and arrest and Baez on her subsequent performance tour was positively reviewed in Time magazine and The New York Times .
Among the songs Baez wrote about this period of her life are `` A Song for David '' , `` Myths '' , `` Prison Trilogy ( Billy Rose ) '' and `` Fifteen Months '' ( the amount of time Harris was imprisoned ) .
Their son Gabriel was born on December 2 , 1969 .
Harris was released from Texas prison after 15 months , but the relationship began to dissolve and the couple divorced amicably in 1973 .
They shared custody of Gabriel , who lived primarily with Baez .
Explaining the split , Baez wrote in her autobiography : `` I am made to live alone .
`` Baez and Harris remained on friendly terms throughout the years ; they reunited on-camera for the 2009 American Masters documentary for the USA’s PBS .
Their son Gabriel is a drummer and occasionally tours with his mother .
He has a daughter Jasmine who also sang with Joan Baez at Kidztock in 2010 .
=== Steve Jobs === Baez dated Apple Computer cofounder Steve Jobs during the early 1980s .
A number of sources have stated that Jobs—then in his mid-20s—had considered asking Baez to marry him , except that her age at the time ( early 40s ) made the possibility of their having children unlikely .
Baez mentioned Jobs in the acknowledgments in her 1987 memoir And a Voice to Sing With and performed at the memorial for him in 2011 .
After Jobs ' death , Baez spoke fondly about him , stating that even after the relationship had ended the two remained friends , with Jobs having visited Baez shortly before his death , and stating that `` Steve had a very sweet side , even if he was as .
.
.
erratic as he was famous for being '' .
=== 2000s–2010s === Baez is a resident of Woodside , California , where she lived with her mother until the latter 's death , aged 100 , in 2013 in a house that has a backyard tree house in which she spends time meditating , writing , and `` being close to nature '' .
She remained close to her younger sister Mimi up until Mimi 's death in 2001 , and as Baez described in the 2009 American Masters documentary , she grew closer to her older sister Pauline before the latter 's death in 2016 .
== Popular culture == Cartoonist Al Capp , creator of the comic strip Li'l Abner , satirized Baez as `` Joanie Phoanie '' during the 1960s .
Joanie was an unabashed communist radical who sang songs of class warfare while hypocritically traveling in a limousine and charging outrageous performance fees to impoverished orphans .
Capp had this character singing bizarre songs such as `` A Tale of Bagels and Bacon '' and `` Molotov Cocktails for Two '' .
Although Baez was upset by the parody in 1966 , she admits to being more amused in recent years .
`` I wish I could have laughed at this at the time '' , she wrote in a caption under one of the strips , reprinted in her autobiography .
`` Mr. Capp confused me considerably .
I 'm sorry he 's not alive to read this , it would make him chuckle .
`` Capp stated at the time : `` Joanie Phoanie is a repulsive , egomaniacal , un-American , non-taxpaying horror , I see no resemblance to Joan Baez whatsoever , but if Miss Baez wants to prove it , let her .

Opera buffa ( pronounced [ ˈɔːpera ˈbuffa ] ; plural : opere buffe ; Italian for `` comic opera '' ) is a genre of opera .
It was first used as an informal description of Italian comic operas variously classified by their authors as commedia in musica , commedia per musica , dramma bernesco , dramma comico , divertimento giocoso .
Especially associated with developments in Naples in the first half of the 18th century , whence its popularity spread to Rome and northern Italy , buffa was at first characterized by everyday settings , local dialects , and simple vocal writing ( the basso buffo is the associated voice type ) , the main requirement being clear diction and facility with patter .
The New Grove Dictionary of Opera considers La Cilla ( music by Michelangelo Faggioli , text by Francesco Antonio Tullio , 1706 ) and Luigi and Federico Ricci 's Crispino e la comare ( 1850 ) to be the first and last appearances of the genre , although the term is still occasionally applied to newer work ( for example Ernst Krenek 's Zeitoper Schwergewicht ) .
High points in this history are the 80 or so libretti by Carlindo Grolo , Loran Glodici , Sogol Cardoni and various other approximate anagrams of Carlo Goldoni , the three Mozart/Da Ponte collaborations , and the comedies of Gioachino Rossini .
Similar foreign genres such as opéra comique or Singspiel differed as well in having spoken dialogue in place of recitativo secco , although one of the most influential examples , Pergolesi 's La serva padrona ( which is an intermezzo , not opera buffa ) , sparked the querelle des bouffons in Paris as an adaptation without sung recitatives .
== History == Comic characters had been a part of opera until the early 18th century , when `` opera buffa '' began to emerge as a separate genre , an early precursor having been the operatic comedy , Il Trespolo tutore , by Alessandro Stradella , in 1679 .
Opera buffa was a parallel development to opera seria and arose in reaction to the so-called first reform of Zeno and Metastasio .
It was , in part , intended as a genre that the common man could relate to more easily .
Whereas opera seria was an entertainment that was both made for and depicted kings and nobility , opera buffa was made for and depicted common people with more common problems .
High-flown language was generally avoided in favor of dialogue that the lower class would relate to , often in the local dialect , and the stock characters were often derived from those of the Italian commedia dell'arte .
In the early 18th century , comic operas often appeared as short , one-act interludes known as intermezzi that were performed in between acts of opera seria .
These gave way to the full-fledged opera buffa later in the 18th century .
La serva padrona by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi ( 1710–1736 ) , is the one intermezzo still performed with any regularity today , and provides an excellent example of the style .
Apart from Pergolesi , the first major composers of opera buffa were Nicola Logroscino , Baldassare Galuppi and Alessandro Scarlatti , all of them based in Naples or Venice .
The opera buffa 's importance diminished during the Romantic Period .
Here , the forms were freer and less extended than in the serious genre and the set numbers were linked by recitativo secco , the exception being Donizetti 's Don Pasquale in 1843 .
With Rossini , a standard distribution of four characters is reached : a prima donna soubrette ( soprano or mezzo ) ; a light , amorous tenor ; a basso cantante or baritone capable of lyrical , mostly ironical expression ; and a basso buffo whose vocal skills , largely confined to clear articulation and the ability to `` patter '' , must also extend to the baritone for the purposes of comic duets .
The type of comedy could vary , and the range was great : from Rossini 's The Barber of Seville in 1816 which was purely comedic , to Mozart 's The Marriage of Figaro in 1786 which added drama and pathos .
Another example of Romantic opera buffa would be Donizetti 's L'elisir d'amore of 1832 .
== Relation to and differences from opera seria == While opera seria deals with gods and ancient heroes and only occasionally contained comic scenes , opera buffa involves the predominant use of comic scenes , characters , and plot lines in a contemporary setting .
The traditional model for opera seria had three acts , dealt with serious subjects in mythical settings , as stated above , and used high voices ( both sopranos and castrati ) for principal characters , often even for monarchs .
In contrast , the model that generally held for opera buffa was having two acts ( as , for example , The Barber of Seville ) , presenting comic scenes and situations as earlier stated and using the lower male voices to the exclusion of the castrati .
This led to the creation of the characteristic `` basso buffo '' , a specialist in patter who was the center of most of the comic action .
( A well-known basso buffo role is Leporello in Mozart 's Don Giovanni ) .

.Operetta is a genre of light opera , light in terms both of music and subject matter .
== Operetta in French == === Origins === Operetta grew out of the French opéra comique around the middle of the 19th century , to satisfy a need for short , light works in contrast to the full-length entertainment of the increasingly serious opéra comique .
By this time , the `` comique '' part of the genre name had become misleading : Georges Bizet 's Carmen ( 1875 ) is an example of an opéra comique with a tragic plot .
The definition of `` comique '' meant something closer to `` humanistic , '' meant to portray `` real life '' in a more realistic way , representing tragedy and comedy next to each other , as Shakespeare had done centuries earlier .
With this new connotation , opéra comique had dominated the French operatic stage since the decline of tragédie lyrique .
Most researchers acknowledge that the credit for creating the operetta form should go to Hervé ( 1825–1892 ) , a singer , composer , librettist , conductor , and scene painter .
In 1842 he wrote the little opérette , L'Ours et le pacha , based on the popular vaudeville by Eugène Scribe and X .
B. Saintine .
In 1848 , Hervé made his first notable appearance on the Parisian stage , with Don Quichotte et Sancho Pança ( after Cervantes ) , which can be considered the starting point for the new French musical theatre tradition .
Hervé 's most famous works are the Gounod-parody Le Petit Faust ( 1869 ) and Mam'zelle Nitouche ( 1883 ) .
=== Offenbach === Jacques Offenbach further developed and popularized operetta , giving it its enormous vogue during the Second Empire and afterwards .
Offenbach 's earliest one-act pieces included Les deux aveugles , Le violoneux and Ba-ta-clan ( all 1855 ) , and his first full-length operetta success was Orphée aux enfers ( 1858 ) .
These led to the so-called `` Offenbachiade '' : works including Geneviève de Brabant 1859 , Le pont des soupirs 1861 , La belle Hélène 1864 , Barbe-bleue and La Vie parisienne both 1866 , La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein 1867 , La Périchole 1868 and Les brigands 1869 .
Offenbach 's tradition was then carried on by Robert Planquette , André Messager , and others .
What characterizes Offenbach 's operettas is both the grotesque way they portray life , and the extremely frivolous way this is done , often bordering on the pornographic .
Émile Zola describes the back-stage and on-stage situation in the Théâtre des Variétés during the Second Empire in his novel Nana , which takes place in late 1860s and describes the career of operetta diva/courtesan Nana .
The character was closely modeled after Offenbach 's female star Hortense Schneider , and Offenbach 's librettist Ludovic Halévy gave Émile Zola the details .
Considering how Zola 's Nana describes an Offenbach-style operetta performance in Paris , it is not surprising that the mostly male , upper-class audience crowded the various theaters every evening .
Upper-class audiences in other cities like Vienna and Berlin longed to see these shows in their home towns as well , which inspired worldwide performance of Offenbach 's works .
The highly erotic way Offenbach 's operettas were originally played , with stars like Hortense Schneider created a scandalized reaction from certain parts of the general public .
Operetta was considered a `` frivolous '' art form .
Indeed , together with its grotesque qualities , frivolity is one of the defining elements of `` authentic '' operetta à la Offenbach and Hervé .
It was only later , when audiences widened and became more middle and lower class , that operetta became more `` serious '' and `` nostalgic '' .
Many of the originally pornographic French ( and Viennese ) operettas were later played in a toned-down , `` classical '' version , which is how audiences today are mostly presented with the genre—in an opera house with opera singers , rather than in a private theatre with courtesans in the lead roles .
== Operetta in German == === Austria-Hungary === The most significant composer of operetta in the German language was the Austrian Johann Strauss II ( 1825–1899 ) .
His first operetta was Indigo und die vierzig Räuber ( 1871 ) .
His third operetta , Die Fledermaus ( 1874 ) , became the most performed operetta in the world , and remains his most popular stage work .
Its libretto was based on a comedy written by Offenbach 's librettists .
In all , Strauss wrote 16 operettas and one opera , most with great success when first premiered .
Many of his lesser operettas are now largely forgotten , since his later librettists were less talented and he often composed independently of the plot .
Strauss 's operettas , waltzes , polkas , and marches often have a strongly Viennese style , and his popularity causes many to think of him as the national composer of Austria .
The Theater an der Wien never failed to draw huge crowds when his stage works were first performed .
After many of the numbers the audience would call noisily for encores .
Franz von Suppé , a contemporary of Strauss , closely modeled his operettas after Offenbach .
The Viennese tradition was carried on by Franz Lehár , Oscar Straus , Carl Zeller , Karl Millöcker , Leo Fall , Richard Heuberger , Edmund Eysler , Ralph Benatzky , Robert Stolz , Emmerich Kálmán , Nico Dostal , Fred Raymond , Igo Hofstetter and Ivo Tijardović in the 20th century .
=== Germany === In the same way that Vienna was the center of Austrian operetta , Berlin was the center of German operetta .
Berlin operetta often had its own style , including , especially after World War I , elements of jazz and other syncopated dance rhythms , a transatlantic style , and the presence of ragged marching tunes .
Berlin operettas also sometimes included aspects of burlesque , revue , farce , or cabaret .
Paul Lincke pioneered the Berlin operetta in 1899 with Frau Luna , which includes `` Berliner Luft '' ( `` Berlin Air '' ) , which became the unofficial anthem of Berlin .
His Lysistrata ( 1902 ) includes the song and tune `` The Glow-Worm '' , which remains quite popular internationally .
Much later , in the 1920s and 1930s , Kurt Weill took a more extreme form of the Berlin operetta style and used it in his operas , operettas , and musicals .
The Berlin-style operetta coexisted with more bourgeois , charming , home-loving , and nationalistic German operettas—some of which were called Volksoperetten ( folk operettas ) .
A prime example is Leon Jessel 's extremely popular 1917 Schwarzwaldmädel ( Black Forest Girl ) .
These bucolic , nostalgic , home-loving operettas were officially preferred over Berlin-style operettas after 1933 , when the Nazis came to power and instituted the Reichsmusikkammer ( State Music Institute ) , which deprecated and banned `` decadent '' music like jazz and similar `` foreign '' musical forms .
Notable German operetta composers include Paul Lincke , Eduard Künneke , Walter Kollo , Jean Gilbert , Leon Jessel , Rudolf Dellinger , Walter Goetze and Ludwig Schmidseder .
== Operetta in English == English-language operettas were first composed in England by the 1860s , for example , Arthur Sullivan 's Cox and Box ( 1866 ) .
Gilbert and Sullivan solidified the format in England with their long-running collaboration during the Victorian era .
With W. S. Gilbert writing the libretti and Sullivan composing the music , the pair produced 14 comic operas , which were later called Savoy Operas .
Most were enormously popular in Britain , the U.S. , and elsewhere .
Sullivan and Gilbert and their producer Richard D'Oyly Carte themselves call their joint works comic operas to distinguish this family-friendly fare from the risqué French operettas of the 1850s and 1860s .
Their works , such as H.M.S .
Pinafore , The Pirates of Penzance and The Mikado , continue to enjoy regular performances throughout the English-speaking world .
English operetta continued into the 1890s , with works by composers such as Edward German , Ivan Caryll and Sidney Jones .
These quickly evolved into the lighter song-and-dance pieces known as Edwardian musical comedy .
Beginning in 1907 , with The Merry Widow , many of the Viennese operettas were adapted very successfully for the English stage .
Old-fashioned musicals in Britain retained an `` operetta-ish '' flavour , at least musically , into the 1950s .
American operetta composers included Victor Herbert , whose works at the beginning of the 20th century were influenced by both Viennese operetta and Gilbert and Sullivan .
He was followed by Sigmund Romberg and Rudolph Friml .
More modern American operettas include Leonard Bernstein 's Candide .
Nevertheless , American operetta largely gave way , by the end of World War I , to musicals , such as the Princess Theatre musicals , and revues , followed by the musicals of Rodgers and Hart , Cole Porter , Irving Berlin and others .
== Definitions == Operettas have similarities to both operas and musicals , and the boundaries between the genres are sometimes blurred .
For instance , American composer Scott Joplin insisted that his serious but ragtime-influenced work Treemonisha ( 1911 ) was an opera , but some reference works characterize it as an operetta .
Likewise , some of Leonard Bernstein 's works he designated as operas ( e.g. , Trouble in Tahiti ) are categorized as operettas , and his operetta Candide is sometimes considered a musical .
=== Operettas and operas === Operettas are usually shorter than operas , and are usually of a light and amusing character .
Operettas are often considered less `` serious '' than operas .
While an opera 's story is usually believable and more relatable to its audience , an operetta aims to simply amuse .
Topical satire is a feature common to many operettas .
However , satire is used in some `` serious '' operas as well : Formerly , in countries such as France , operas expressed politics in code—for example , the circumstances of the title character in the opera Robert le diable referred , at its first performance , to the French king 's parental conflict and its resolution .
Normally some of the libretto of an operetta is spoken rather than sung .
Instead of moving from one musical number to another , the musical segments—e.g .
aria , recitative , chorus—are interspersed with periods of dialogue .
There is usually no musical accompaniment to the dialogue , although sometimes some musical themes are played quietly under it .
Short passages of recitative are , however , sometimes used in operetta , especially as an introduction to a song .
=== Operettas and musicals === The operetta is a precursor of the modern musical theatre or the `` musical '' .
In the early decades of the 20th century , the operetta continued to exist alongside the newer musical , with each influencing the other .
The main difference between the two genres is that most operettas can be described as light operas with acting , whereas most musicals are plays with singing and dancing .
This can be seen in the performers chosen in the two forms .
An operetta 's cast will normally consist of classically trained opera singers .
A musical may use actors who are not operatically trained , and usually the principals are called upon to dance .
These distinctions can be blurred : Ezio Pinza and other opera singers have appeared on Broadway .
There are features of operetta in Kern and Hammerstein 's Show Boat ( 1927 ) , among others .
The characters in a musical may be more complex than those in an operetta , given the generally larger amount of dialogue .
For example , the characters in Lerner and Loewe 's musical My Fair Lady , which is based on George Bernard Shaw 's 1914 play Pygmalion , are essentially unchanged from those in Shaw 's stage work , because the musical version is quite faithful to the original ( except for the changed ending , which is pessimistic in the play ) , even to the point of retaining most of Shaw 's dialogue .
Man of la Mancha , adapted by Dale Wasserman from his own ninety-minute television play I , Don Quixote , retains much of the dialogue in that play , cutting only enough to make room for the musical numbers which were added when the play was converted into a stage musical .

A rave ( from the verb : to rave ) is a large dance party at a nightclub , dance club or festival featuring performances by DJs , who select and mix a seamless flow of loud electronic dance music songs and tracks .
DJs at rave events play electronic dance music on vinyl , CDs and digital audio from a wide range of genres , including acid house , acid trance , hardcore , breakbeat , UK garage , and free tekno .
Occasionally live performers playing synthesizer or other electronic instruments will play electronic music .
The music is amplified with a large , powerful sound reinforcement system , typically with huge subwoofers to produce a deep bass sound .
The music is often accompanied by laser light shows , projected coloured images , visual effects and fog machines .
The word `` rave '' was first used in the late 1980s to describe the culture that started at many Midlands Universities including : Wolverhampton , Coventry and De Montfort University movement .
While some raves may be small parties held at nightclubs or private homes , some raves have grown to immense size , such as the large festivals and events featuring multiple DJs and dance areas ( e.g. , the Castlemorton Common Festival in 1992 ) .
Some electronic dance music festivals have features of raves , but on a larger , often commercial scale .
Raves may last for a long time , with some events continuing for twenty-four hours , and lasting all through the night .
Law enforcement raids and anti-rave laws have been used against the rave scene in many countries .
This is due to the association of illegal club drugs such as MDMA ( ecstasy ) and party drugs ( such as BZP ) , and the use of non-authorized , secret venues for some raves , such as squat parties at unused warehouses or aircraft hangars .
In part , this is due to the media attention and moral panic that has arisen when ever rave participants have adverse drug reactions .
== History == === Origin of 'rave ' ( 1950s–1970s ) === In the late 1950s in London the term `` rave '' was used to describe the `` wild bohemian parties '' of the Soho beatnik set .
In 1958 , Buddy Holly recorded the hit `` Rave On , '' citing the madness and frenzy of a feeling and the desire for it never to end .
The word `` rave '' was later used in the burgeoning mod youth culture of the early 1960s as the way to describe any wild party in general .
People who were gregarious party animals were described as `` ravers '' .
Pop musicians such as Steve Marriott of The Small Faces and Keith Moon of The Who were self-described `` ravers '' .
Presaging the word 's subsequent 1980s association with electronic music , the word `` rave '' was a common term used regarding the music of mid-1960s garage rock and psychedelia bands ( most notably The Yardbirds , who released an album in the US called Having a Rave Up ) .
Along with being an alternative term for partying at such garage events in general , the `` rave-up '' referred to a specific crescendo moment near the end of a song where the music was played faster , more heavily and with intense soloing or elements of controlled feedback .
It was later part of the title of an electronic music performance event held on 28 January 1967 at London 's Roundhouse titled the `` Million Volt Light and Sound Rave '' .
The event featured the only known public airing of an experimental sound collage created for the occasion by Paul McCartney of The Beatles – the legendary Carnival of Light recording .
With the rapid change of British pop culture from the mod era of 1963–1966 to the hippie era of 1967 and beyond , the term fell out of popular usage .
During the 1970s and early 1980s until its resurrection , the term was not in vogue , one notable exception being in the lyrics of the song `` Drive-In Saturday '' by David Bowie ( from his 1973 album Aladdin Sane ) which includes the line , `` It 's a crash course for the ravers .
`` Its use during that era would have been perceived as a quaint or ironic use of bygone slang : part of the dated 1960s lexicon along with words such as `` groovy '' .
In 1977 , at the height of the disco era , a new nightclub and discothèque was opened in New York City .
The club , Studio 54 , created a new model for what a elaborate , elite dance club .
The club spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on complex lighting systems and the dance floors had theatrical sets that could be changed for different events .
In the late 1970s , the club was the best-known nightclub in the world .
The club played a formative role in the growth of DJ-fuelled disco music and nightclub culture .
The club was notorious for its subjective and often restrictive entry policy , frequent celebrity attendees ( Andy Warhol , Mick Jagger , etc ) and open drug use and promiscuity .
The perception of the word `` rave '' changed again in the late 1980s when the term was revived and adopted by a new youth culture , possibly inspired by the use of the term in Jamaica .
=== Birth of acid house ( 1980s ) === In the mid to late 1980s , a wave of psychedelic and other electronic dance music , most notably acid house music , emerged from acid house music parties in the mid-to-late 1980s in the Chicago area in the United States .
After Chicago acid house artists began experiencing overseas success , acid house quickly spread and caught on in the United Kingdom within clubs , warehouses and free-parties , first in Manchester in the mid-1980s and then later in London .
In the late 1980s , the word `` rave '' was adopted to describe the subculture that grew out of the acid house movement .
Activities were related to the party atmosphere of Ibiza , a Mediterranean island in Spain , frequented by British , Italian , Greek , Irish and German youth on vacation , who would hold raves and dance parties .
=== Growth of the scene ( 1990s–present ) === By the 1990s , genres such as house , trance , acid house , acid trance , oldschool jungle , breakbeat hardcore , hardcore , techno and electronica were all being featured at raves , both large and small .
There were mainstream events which attracted thousands of people ( up to 25,000 instead of the 4,000 that came to earlier warehouse parties ) .
Acid house music parties were first re-branded `` rave parties '' in the media , during the summer of 1989 by Genesis P-Orridge ( Neil Andrew Megson ) during a television interview ; however , the ambience of the rave was not fully formed until the early 1990s .
In the UK , in 1988–89 , raves were similar to football matches , in that they provided a setting for working-class unification , at a time of union movement in decline and few jobs .
Many of the attendees of raves were die-hard football fans .
In 1990 , raves were also held `` underground '' in several cities , such as Berlin , Milan and Patras , in basements , warehouses and forests .
British politicians responded with hostility to the emerging rave party trend .
Politicians spoke out against raves and began to fine promoters who held unauthorized parties .
Police crackdowns on these often unauthorized parties drove the rave scene into the countryside .
The word `` rave '' somehow caught on in the UK to describe common semi-spontaneous weekend parties occurring at various locations linked by the brand new M25 London orbital motorway that ringed London and the Home Counties .
( It was this that gave the band Orbital their name .
) These ranged from former warehouses and industrial sites in London , to fields and country clubs in the countryside .
== Characteristics == === Location === Prior to the commercialization of the rave scene , when large legal venues became the norm for these events , the location of the rave was kept secret until the night of the event , usually being communicated through mobile messaging , secret flyers , and websites .
This level of secrecy , necessary for avoiding any interference by the police , on account of the illicit drug use , enabled the ravers to use locations they could stay in for ten hours at a time .
It promoted the sense of deviance and removal from social control .
In the 2000s , this level of secrecy still exists in the underground rave scene .
However `` after-hours '' clubs , as well as large outdoor events , create a similar type of alternate atmosphere , but focus much more on vibrant visual effects , such as props and décor .
In more recent years , large commercial events are held at the same locations year after year with similar reoccurring themes every year .
Events like Electric Daisy Carnival and Tomorrowland are typically held at the same venue that holds mass numbers of people .
Some raves make use of pagan symbolism .
Modern raving venues attempt to immerse the raver in a fantasy-like world .
Indigenous imagery and spirituality can be characteristic in the Raving ethos .
In both the New Moon and Gateway collectives , `` pagan altars are set up , sacred images from primitive cultures decorate the walls , and rituals of cleansing are performed over the turntables and the dance floor '' This type of spatial strategy is an integral part of the raving experience because it sets the initial `` vibe '' in which the ravers will immerse themselves .
This said `` vibe '' is a concept in the raver ethos that represents the allure and receptiveness of an environment 's portrayed and or innate energy .
The landscape is an integral feature in the composition of rave , much like it is in pagan rituals .
For example , The Numic Ghost Dancers rituals were held on specific geographical sites , considered to hold powerful natural flows of energy .
These sites were later represented in the rhythmic dances , in order to achieve a greater level of connectivity .
==== Notable venues ==== The following is an incomplete list of venues associated with the rave subculture : === Dancing === A sense of participation in a group event is among the chief appeals of rave music and dancing to pulsating beats is its immediate outlet .
Raving in itself is a syllabus-free dance , whereby the movements are not predefined and the dance is performed randomly , dancers take immediate inspiration from the music , their mood and watching other people dancing .
Thus , the electronic , rave and club dances refer to the street dance styles that evolved alongside electronic music culture .
Such dances are street dances since they evolved alongside the underground rave and club movements , without the intervention of dance studios .
These dances were originated in some 'scenes ' around the world , becoming known only to ravers or clubgoers who attempt to these locations .
They were originated at some point that certain moves had begun to be performed to several people at those places , creating a completely freestyle , yet still highly complex set of moves , adaptable to every dancer change and dance whatever they want based on these moves .
A common feature shared by all these dances , alongside with being originated at clubs , raves and music festivals around the world and in different years , is that when YouTube and other social media started to become popular ( around 2006 ) , these dances began to be popularized by videos of raves performing them , recording and uploading their videos .
Therefore , they began to be practiced outside their places of origin , creating different 'scenes ' in several countries .
Furthermore , some of these dances began to evolve , and these dance 'scenes ' are not totally related to the club/rave scenes they were originated .
Also , the way of teaching and learning them have changed .
In the past , if someone wanted to learn one of these dances , the person had to go to a club/rave , watch people dancing and try to copy them .
Now , with social media , these dances are mostly taught on video tutorials and the culture spreads and grows inside those social media , like Flogger on Fotolog , Rebolation , Sensualize and Free Step on Orkut and Cutting Shapes on Instagram .
Due the lack of studies dedicated to those dances , combined with poor and inaccurate information of them available on the Internet , it is hard to find reliable information .
=== Attire === The loose , casual and sports clothing was originally adopted by the acid house set earlier on in Ibiza , utilizing easy-to-dance-in attire from hip hop and football/soccer culture .
As well as clothing there developed a range of accessories carried by many ravers including : Vicks VapoRub , which ravers find pleasant under the influence of MDMA , pacifiers to satiate the need to grind one 's teeth ( bruxism ) caused by taking MDMA , and glow sticks which adjunct the mild psychedelia of MDMA 's effect .
This led some clubs and event organizers to search participants on entry and confiscate such items due to it being evidence of drug use inside the venue .
Recent global rave events such as Sensation have a strict minimalistic dress policy , either all white or black attire .
This ties in with the initial PLUR approach upheld from earlier rave culture .
In the United States and other countries , rave fashion is characterized by colorful clothing and accessories , most notably `` kandi '' jewellery , that fluoresce under ultraviolet light .
They contain words or phrases that are unique to the raver and they can choose to trade with each other using `` PLUR '' ( Peace , Love , Unity , Respect ) .
In European countries , this kandi culture is much less common .
Most raves are illegal and take place outside or in poorly heated warehouses , so keeping warm is a priority .
Dreadlocks , dyed hair and mohawks are popular , as are tattoos and piercings .
Clothing is vibrant and alternative , often taking inspiration from new-age punk and grunge style .
However , there is no set dress code for the illegal rave scene .
Since rave culture has seen such an explosion in the US since 2010 as the rave scene is no longer illegal or underground , raves in the US are now so popular that there are many brands , retailers , and websites selling apparel , costumes , and accessories just for those who go to dress up at raves .
This style of attire , along with the entire rave culture , is now spilling out into the mainstream , especially in the US .
Sometimes called `` rave fashion '' or `` festival fashion , '' it now includes all kinds of accessories to create unique looks depending on the person and event .
Items such as jewelry , body chains , temporary tattoos , furry leg warmers ( also known as fluffies ) , sunglasses , fanny packs , pasties , light up items , spirit hoods , and much more can be seen at any major rave event around the US and globe .
There has also been a recent trend in the use of Diffraction and Kaleidoscope Glasses in the festival industry to create or enhance an MDMA or ecstasy experience .
=== Light shows === Some ravers participate in one of four light-oriented dances , called glowsticking , glowstringing , gloving , and lightshows .
Of the four types of light-orientated dances , gloving in particular has evolved beyond and outside of the rave culture .
Other types of light-related dancing include LED lights , flash-lights and blinking strobe lights .
LEDs come in various colours with different settings .
Gloving has evolved into a separate dance form that has grown exponentially in the last couple of years while still keeping its rave roots .
The origins of gloving is often credited to Hermes who put together 10 Rav'n lights into a pair of white gloves in 2006 .
Since then the culture has extended to all ages , ranging from kids in their early teens to college students and more .
The traditional Rav'n lights are limited now , but many stores have developed newer , brighter , and more advanced version of lights with a plethora of colors and modes—modes include solid , stribbon , strobe , dops , hyper flash , and other variations .
=== Drug use === Among the various elements of 1970s disco subculture that ravers drew on , in addition to basing their scene around dance music mixed by DJs , an element common to disco and the rave scene , ravers also inherited the positive attitude towards using club drugs to `` enhanc [ e ] ... the sensory experience '' of dancing to loud music .
However , disco dancers and ravers preferred different drugs .
Whereas 1970s disco scene members preferred cocaine and the depressant/sedative Quaaludes , ravers preferred MDMA , 2C-B , amphetamine , morphine and other pills .
According to the FBI , raves are one of the most popular venues where club drugs are distributed , and as such feature a prominent drug subculture .
Club drugs include MDMA ( more commonly known as `` ecstasy '' , `` E '' or `` molly '' ) , 2C-B ( more commonly known as `` nexus '' ) , amphetamine ( commonly referred to as `` speed '' ) , morphine ( commonly known as `` morphy '' or `` M '' ) , GHB ( commonly referred to as `` fantasy '' or `` liquid E '' ) , cocaine ( common short name for `` coke '' ) , DMT and LSD ( commonly referred to as `` lucy '' or `` acid '' ) .
`` Poppers '' is the street name for alkyl nitrites ( the most well-known being amyl nitrite ) , which are inhaled for their intoxicating effects , notably the `` rush '' or `` high '' they can provide .
Nitrites originally came as small glass capsules that were popped open , which led to the nickname `` poppers .
`` The drug became popular in the US first on the disco/club scene of the 1970s and then at dance and rave venues in the 1980s and 1990s .
In the 2000s , synthetic phenethylamines such as 2C-I , 2C-B and DOB have been referred to as club drugs due to their stimulating and psychedelic nature ( and their chemical relationship with MDMA ) .
By late 2012 , derivates of the psychedelic 2C-X drugs , the NBOMes and especially 25I-NBOMe , had become common at raves in Europe .
In the U.S. , some law enforcement agencies have branded the subculture as a drug-centric culture , as rave attendees have been known to use drugs such as marijuana , 2CB , and DMT .
Groups that have addressed alleged drug use at raves e.g .
the Electronic Music Defense and Education Fund ( EM : DEF ) , The Toronto Raver Info Project ( Canada ) , DanceSafe ( USA and Canada ) , and Eve & Rave ( Germany and Switzerland ) , all of which advocate harm reduction approaches .
In 2005 , Antonio Maria Costa , Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime , advocated drug testing on highways as a countermeasure against drug use at raves .
Much of the controversy , moral panic and law enforcement attention directed at rave culture and its association with drug use may be due to reports of drug overdoses ( particularly MDMA ) at raves , concerts and festivals .
== History by country == === Germany === By 1987 , a German party scene , started by Tauseef Alam , based on the Chicago House sound was well established .
The following year ( 1988 ) saw acid house making as significant an impact on popular consciousness in Germany and Central Europe as it had in England .
In 1989 German DJs Westbam and Dr. Motte established the Ufo Club , an illegal party venue , and co-founded the Love Parade .
On 9 November 1989 the Berlin Wall fell , free underground Techno parties mushroomed in East Berlin , and a rave scene comparable to that in the UK was established .
East German DJ Paul van Dyk has remarked that the Techno-based rave scene was a major force in re-establishing social connections between East and West Germany during the unification period .
In urbanized Germany raves and techno parties often preferred industrial sceneries such as decommissioned power stations , factories , the canalization or former military properties of the cold war .
In 1991 a number of party venues closed , including Ufo , and the Berlin Techno scene centred itself around three locations close to the foundations of the Berlin Wall : the E-Werk , the Bunker and the now legendary Tresor .
In the same period , German DJs began intensifying the speed and abrasiveness of the sound , as an acid-infused techno began transmuting into hardcore .
This emerging sound was influenced by Dutch gabber and Belgian hardcore .
Other influences on the development of this style were European Electronic Body Music groups of the mid-1980s such as DAF , Front 242 , and Nitzer Ebb .
Across Europe , rave culture was becoming part of a new youth movement .
DJs and electronic-music producers such as Westbam proclaimed the existence of a `` raving society '' and promoted electronic music as legitimate competition for rock and roll .
Indeed , electronic dance music and rave subculture became mass movements .
Since the mid 1990s , raves had tens of thousands of attendees , youth magazines featured styling tips , and television networks launched music magazines on House and Techno music .
The annual Love Parade festivals in Berlin and later the Metropolitan Ruhr area repeatedly attracted more than one million party-goers between 1997 and 2010 .
Dozens of other annual technoparades took place in Germany and Central Europe at that time , the largest ones being Union Move , Generation Move , Reincarnation and Vision Parade as well as Street Parade and Lake Parade in Switzerland .
Large commercial raves since the nineties include Mayday , Nature One , Time Warp , SonneMondSterne and Melt ! .
Beyond Berlin , further centers of the techno and rave scene of the 1990s and 2000s in Germany were Frankfurt ( famous clubs were Omen , Dorian Gray , Cocoon and U60311 ) and Munich ( Ultraschall , KW – Das Heizkraftwerk , Natraj Temple , Harry Klein and Rote Sonne ) .
Further popular venues include Stammheim ( Aufschwung Ost ) in Kassel , Tunnel Club in Hamburg and Distillery in Leipzig .
Since the late 2000s , Berlin is still called the capital of electro music and rave , and techno clubs such as Berghain , Tresor , Watergate or KitKatClub and the way to party in barely renovated venues , ruins or wooden shacks such as , among many others , Club der Visionaere , Wilde Renate , Fiese Remise or Bar 25 , attracted international media attention .
One movie that portraits this recent scene is Berlin Calling starring Paul Kalkbrenner .
=== United Kingdom === ==== Birth of UK rave scene ( 1980s-1990s ) ==== The UK was finally recognized for its rave culture around the late 1980s early 1990s .
EXODUS collective which was founded in Luton famously known for London Luton airport and hat manufacturing .
Exodus played a big part in the UK 's rave scene today .
By 1991 , organisations such as Fantazia , Universe , N.A.S.A `` Nice And Safe Attitude '' , Raindance and Amnesia House were holding massive legal raves in fields and warehouses around the country .
One Fantazia party , called One Step Beyond , was an open-air , all-night affair that attracted 30,000 people .
Other notable events included Vision at Pophams airfield in August 1992 , with 40,000 in attendance and Universe 's Tribal Gathering in 1993 .
In the early 1990s , the scene was slowly changing , with local councils passing by-laws and increasing fees in an effort to prevent or discourage rave organisations from acquiring necessary licenses .
This meant that the days of legal one-off parties were numbered .
By the mid-1990s , the scene had fragmented into many different styles of dance music , making large parties more expensive to set up and more difficult to promote .
The happy old skool style was replaced by the darker jungle and the faster happy hardcore .
Although many ravers left the scene due to the split , promoters such as ESP Dreamscape and Helter Skelter still enjoyed widespread popularity and capacity attendances with multi-arena events catering to the various genres .
Notable events of this period included ESP 's Dreamscape 20 on 9 September 1995 at Brafield aerodrome fields , Northants and Helter Skelter 's Energy 97 event on 9 Aug 1997 at Turweston Aerodrome , Northants .
==== Free parties and outlawing of raves ( 1992-1994 ) ==== The illegal free party scene also reached its zenith for that time after a particularly large festival , when many individual sound systems such as Bedlam , Circus Warp , DIY , and Spiral Tribe set up near Castlemorton Common .
In May 1992 , the government acted .
Under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 , the definition of music played at a rave was given as : '' Music '' includes sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats .
–Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 Sections 63 , 64 & 65 of the Act targeted electronic dance music played at raves .
The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act empowered police to stop a rave in the open air when a hundred or more people are attending , or where two or more are making preparations for a rave .
Section 65 allows any uniformed constable who believes a person is on their way to a rave within a five-mile radius to stop them and direct them away from the area ; non-compliant citizens may be subject to a maximum fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale ( £1000 ) .
The Act was officially introduced because of the noise and disruption caused by all night parties to nearby residents , and to protect the countryside .
However , some participants in the scene claimed it was an attempt to lure youth culture away from MDMA and back to taxable alcohol .
In November 1994 , the Zippies staged an act of electronic civil disobedience to protest against the CJB ( i.e. , Criminal Justice Bill ) .
==== Legal and underground raves ( 1994-present ) ==== After 1993 , the main outlet for raves in the UK were a number of licensed venues , amongst them Helter Skelter , Life at Bowlers ( Trafford Park , Manchester ) , The Edge ( formerly the Eclipse [ Coventry ] ) , The Sanctuary ( Milton Keynes ) and Club Kinetic .
In London , itself , there were a few large clubs that staged raves on a regular basis , most notably `` The Laser Dome '' , `` The Fridge '' , `` The Hippodrome '' , `` Club U.K. '' , and `` Trade .
`` `` The Laser Dome '' featured two separate dance areas , `` Hardcore '' and `` Garage '' , as well as over 20 video game machines , a silent-movie screening lounge , replicas of the `` Statue of Liberty '' , `` San Francisco Bridge '' , and a large glass maze .
At capacity `` The Laser Dome '' held in excess of 6,000 people .
Events proved to be one of the main forces in rave , holding legendary events across the north-east and Scotland .
Initially playing Techno , Breakbeat , Rave and drum and bass , it later embraced hardcore techno including happy hardcore and bouncy techno .
Judgement Day , History of Dance , and now REGENeration continued the Rezerection legacy .
Scotland 's clubs , such as the FUBAR in Stirling , Hangar 13 in Ayr , and Nosebleed in Rosyth played important roles in the development of these dance music styles .
These were nearly all pay-to-enter events ; however , it could be argued that rave organisers saw the writing on the wall and moved towards more organised and `` legitimate '' venues , enabling a continuation of large-scale indoor raves well into the mid-nineties .
One might remember that the earliest house and acid house clubs were themselves effectively `` nightclubs '' .
Public perception of raves was also overshadowed in the press by the 1995 death of Leah Betts , a teenager who died after taking MDMA ; journalists and billboard campaigns focused on drug use , despite Betts cause of death being water intoxication in her home , not an MDMA overdose at a rave .
In London , the warehouse party scene has made a revival , with many large clubs closing , popular DJs are playing in abandoned car parks , warehouses , factories etc .
Many put this down to the recession , nightclubs and bars being less affordable than in the past few years , a similar situation to the late 1980s and early 1990s when house music and rave took off .
Genuine illegal raves have continued throughout the UK and unlicensed parties have been organised in venues including disused quarries , warehouses , and condemned night clubs .
The rise of the Internet has both helped and hindered the cause , with much wider and more accessible communication resulting in bigger parties , but consequently increasing the risk of police involvement .
=== North America === ==== Origins in disco and psychedelia ( 1970s ) ==== American ravers , following their early UK & European counterparts , have been compared to the hippies of the 1960s due to their shared interest in non-violence and psychedelia .
Rave culture incorporated disco culture 's same love of dance music spun by DJs , drug exploration , sexual promiscuity , and hedonism .
Although disco culture had thrived in the mainstream , the rave culture would make an effort to stay underground to avoid the animosity that was still surrounding disco and dance music .
The key motive for remaining underground in many parts of the US had to do with curfew and the standard 2:00 am closing of clubs .
It was a desire to keep the party going past legal hours that created the underground direction .
Because of the legality , they had to be secretive about time and place .
Most did not have drugs or alcohol , that came later .
==== New York raves and party promoters ( 1980s ) ==== In the late 1980s , rave culture began to filter through into North America from English expatriates and from US DJs who would visit Europe .
However , rave culture 's major expansion in North America is often credited to Frankie Bones , who after spinning a party in an aircraft hangar in England , helped organize some of the earliest American raves in the 1990s in New York City called `` Storm Raves '' .
Storm Raves had a consistent core audience , fostered by zines by fellow Storm DJ ( and co-founder , with Adam X and Frankie Bones , of the US ' first techno record store , Groove Records .
) Heather Heart 's Under One Sky .
Simultaneously in NYC , events called NASA were introducing electronic dance music to this city 's dance scene .
In 1993 , P.A.W.N .
LASERS from Pennsylvania produced the 1st electronic Dance Festival `` IMPACT '' with Josh Wink , DJ Keoki in PA , and then later became a laser company at raves in East Coast .
Between 1992 and 1994 , promotional groups sprung up across the east coast such as Ultraworld ( MD , DC ) , Park Rave Madness ( NYC ) , Satellite Productions ( NYC ) , G.O .
Guaranteed Overdose ( NYC ) , Local 13 ( NJ ) , Caffeine ( NYC ) , Liquid Grooove aka Liquified ( GA ) , Columns of Knowledge ( CT ) , Special K aka Circle Management ( PA ) , Zen Festivals ( FL ) , Disco Donnie ( LA ) , Ultra Music Festival ( FL ) , and later the west coast , causing a stronger `` scene '' to develop .
==== San Diego and Latin America ( 1990s ) ==== In the 1990s , an influential rave organizer and promoters was San Diego 's Global Underworld Network .
They held the OPIUM and NARNIA raves with audiences of thousands .
Narnia which would become famous for a morning hand-holding circle of unity was featured on MTV and twice in LIFE magazine being honored with Event of the Year in 1995 .
Narnia became known as the `` Woodstock of Generation X '' .
Nicholas Luckinbill and Branden Powers of G.U.N .
were called the Merry Pranksters of the Rave scene , a reference to the Ken Kesey 's 1960s counterculture .
These festivals were held on Indian reservations and ski resorts during the summer months and were headlined by well-known DJs such as Doc Martin , Dimitri of Deee-lite , Afrika Islam and the Hardkiss brothers from San Francisco .
They helped to create the Right to Dance movement—a non violent protest held in San Diego and later in Los Angeles on the steps of City Hall which communicated the message that rave culture was about community , peace and love .
The goal of the protest was to counteract the moral panic that existed in mass media , which alleged that ravers were heavy club drug users .
Featuring local San Diego DJs Jon Bishop , Steve Pagan , Alien Tom , Jeff Skot and Mark E. Quark , Global Underworld 's events were the events to use large props and themes in America .
They were also the first production company to throw raves in Mexico , launching the rave culture movement within South America .
The fairy and pixie craze , with ravers getting fairy tattoos and wearing fairy wings to parties started from an image of a winged fairy on the first Narnia flyer .
The Crystal Method played their first out of town show for G.U.N .
's Universary event .
Fearing reprisals from the police , the event was advertised as `` A thousand Points of Light '' referring to the power of healing crystals of the Crystal Methods name .
Upcoming artists refereed to this event years later in their biographies .
The communal space hosting the G.U.N .
office amongst many others—something of a Waco meets Warhol in the MIT media lab—was a crossroads of the scene .
This vibrant , weird , & chaotic top three stories of a building in downtown San Diego , unceremoniously known as `` The Loft '' , grew out of an unlikely collaboration between Alabama yoga guru Murshid Van Merlin , hackers Jerry Lugert & Bill Huey , & Sin Magazine editor Chris Howland .
In contrast to the commercial-oriented mega raves , the Loft hosted intimate parties over the years & provided an art , technology and creativity incubator for thousands in the SD underground scene of the 1990s .
The percussive group Crash Worship in particular , sometimes working out of the Loft , mechanistically generated the essence of techno tribal-Dionysian abandon of the rave scene roots .
This scene marks the post-industrial , pre-rave period of tranced out dance parties in the U.S .
Adults are often active members of the U.S. scene and are well represented at events .
Certain facets of dance music culture in the UK , Europe and globally , are also welcoming to the older generation ( especially the free party/squat party/gay scenes ) .
However , rave and club culture remains on the whole very much a youth-driven movement in terms of its core fan base .
Although rave parties are commonly associated with warehouse break-ins & such , raves themselves are more often considered to be legal , and often commercial gatherings .
==== Growth in California ==== In the late 1980s and early 1990s , there was a boom in rave culture in the Bay Area .
At first , small underground parties sprung up all over the SOMA district in vacant warehouses , loft spaces , and clubs like DV8 and 1015 Folsom , and basement of Jessie Street that had permits to run to 6 am as long as no alcohol was served .
The no alcohol rule fueled the ecstasy-driven parties to a much larger crowd , and soon the first large scale raves were held .
Every weekend a few hundred would show up at venues like the Townsend warehouse , the King Street garage , and other mid-size warehouses located in the SOMA and south San Francisco area .
Rave crews started to become famous not only for their music and parties but also for the 'vibe ' .
Crews included 'The Gathering ' , 'Toontown ' , 'Wiked ' , 'Rave Called Sharon ' , 'The Church ' , and 'Osmosis ' .
Small underground raves were just starting out and expanding beyond SF to include the East Bay , the South Bay area including San Jose , Santa Clara , and Santa Cruz beaches ( where the 'full moon raves ' took place at Bonny Dune beach every month ) .
In late 1991 , raves started to expand across northern California , and cities like Sacramento , Oakland , Silicon Valley ( Palo Alto , San Jose ) holding raves every weekend .
This proved to be the turning point in northern California 's rave history .
Raves were no longer a secret , where one had to know the right people to gain access to map points .
Now rave flyers were to be found up and down Haight Street , at stores like Anubis Warpus , Amoeba , Behind The Post Office , and at the newly opened Housewares .
Toontown 's NYE 91 rave , which took place in the basement of the Fashion Center in SF was the first massive rave in the Bay Area .
Over 8,000 people participated .
Similarly , a year later , 'The Gathering ' held New Year 's Eve of 1992 in Vallejo with 12,000 people .
The massive parties were taking place in outdoor fields , airplane hangars and hilltops that surround the valley .
San Francisco has long been a Mecca for ravers from all over the world .
A lot of the early promoters and DJs were from the UK and Europe .
For almost ten years after the initial raves took place , there were several parties each weekend .
There was no curfew in place .
Some venues would have up to 20,000 people every weekend ; 'Homebase ' , and '85 & Baldwin ' were the largest venues to be used in the Bay Area .
Raves took place the SOMA art museum , 'Where the wild things are ' museum on top of the Sony Metreon , and in the Maritime hall ( 1998-2002 ) .
Some old locations were re-used , such as the concourse that saw thousands of ravers in 1992 , was used again in 1999 .
The galleria that once held a 'concert ' in 1992 with artists such as Moby , Aphex twin , Prodigy and Space time continuum , was used for a few one-off events that utilized all five floors of the building with a different music style on each floor .
The mid-1990s saw a general loss of the first generation of ravers , causing the scene to take a short dive .
In this time , however , a new West Coast sound was formed and developed by DJs such as Jeno , Tony , Spun , Galen , Solar , Harry Who ? , and Rick Preston .
Venues and parties such as Stompy , Harmony , CloudFactory , Cyborganic lounge , Acme warehouse started to fuse the Breakbeat sound from hardcore trax with the more melodic pace of house music .
West coast funky break-beat was born from this and stormed the dance scene .
By the end of 1994 , a new generation of ravers were attracted by the new sounds .
LA Scene promoters such as Vince Bannon and Phil Blaine held gigs for electronic acts like 808 State , Aphex Twin , Prodigy , and Massive Attack .
EDM began to become popular .
Raves could be found in many different kinds of venues , as opposed to just basements and warehouses .
Promoters started to take notice and put together the massives of the late 1990s with many music forms under one roof for 12-hour events .
Parties were known to attract tens of thousands in venues like Homebase or 85th/Baldwin for a night of continuous dancing .
San Francisco became a notorious destination for raves in the United States , and to a lesser extent , the world at large .
DJs from all corners of the globe began performing in San Francisco .
2000 saw the demise of massive raves as curfews were placed on permits handed out to promoters .
Instead of all night and into the next day , parties now had to end at 2 a.m. Two of the largest venues closed down soon after , and there was n't enough momentum to sustain parties that catered to tens of thousands of people .
The Homebase warehouse that held parties from 1996-2000 burned down in 2004 .
Smaller , intimate venues continued just like they had from the start and underground raves became the norm in the years after the tech boom of the 1990s .
While San Francisco 's crowd attendance and variety of DJs might have peaked , it still maintains a much smaller but dedicated cadre of various crews , DJs , promoters and producers .
Events are still dedicated to the various forms of electronic music across the greater Bay Area .
The death of Sasha Rodgriguez at the Electric Daisy Carnival in 2010 put a negative spin on raves in LA and California .
==== Seattle ==== Through the mid 1990s and into the 2000s the city of Seattle also shared in the tradition of West Coast rave culture .
Though a smaller scene compared to San Francisco , Seattle also had many different rave crews , promoters , Djs , and fans .
Candy Raver style , friendship and culture became popular in the West Coast rave scene , both in Seattle and San Francisco .
At the peak of West Coast rave , Candy Raver , and massive rave popularity ( 1996-1999 , ) it was common to meet groups of ravers , promoters , and Djs who frequently travelled between Seattle and San Francisco , which spread the overall sense of West Coast rave culture and the phenomenon of West Coast `` massives '' .
==== Recent years ( 2000s ) ==== By 2010 , raves were becoming the equivalent of large-scale rock music festivals , but many times even bigger and more profitable .
The Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas drew more than 300,000 fans over three days in the summer of 2012 , making it the largest EDM music festival in North America .
Ultra Music Festival in Miami drew 150,000 fans over three days in 2012 while other raves like Electric Zoo in New York , Beyond Wonderland in LA , Movement in Detroit , Electric Forest in Michigan , Spring Awakening in Chicago , and dozens more now attract hundreds of thousands of `` ravers '' every year .
These new EDM-based rave events ( now simply referred generically to as `` music festivals '' ) sell out .
Festival attendance at the Electric Daisy Carnival ( EDC ) increased by 39.1 % , or 90,000 attendees from 2011 to 2012 .
In 2013 , EDC had attendance of approximately 345,000 people , a record for the festival .
The average ticket for EDC cost over $ 300 and the event contributed $ 278 million to the Clark County economy in 2013 .
This festival takes place at a 1,000-acre complex featuring a half dozen custom built stages , enormous interactive art installations , and hundreds of EDM artists .
Insomniac , a US EDM event promoter , holds yearly EDC and other EDM events .
=== Australia === ==== 1980s and 1990s : outdoor raves and the Sydney scene ==== Rave parties began in Australia as early as the 1980s and continued well into the late 1990s .
They were mobilised versions of the 'warehouse parties ' , across Britain .
Similar to the United States and Britain , raves in Australia were unlicensed and held in spaces normally used for industrial and manufacturing purposes , such as warehouses , factories and carpet showrooms .
In addition , suburban locations were also used : basketball gymnasiums , train stations and even circus tents were all common venues .
In Sydney , common areas used for outdoor events included Sydney Park , a reclaimed garbage dump in the inner south west of the city , Cataract Park and various other natural , unused locations and bush lands .
The raves placed a heavy emphasis on the connection between humans and the natural environment , thus many raves in Sydney were held outdoors , notably the 'Happy Valley ' parties ( 1991-1994 ) , 'Ecology ' ( 1992 ) and 'Field of Dreams 4 ' ( July 6 , 1996 ) .
The mid-late 1990s saw a slight decline in rave attendance , attributed to the death of Anna Wood at a licensed inner-city Sydney venue , which was hosting a rave party known as `` Apache '' .
Wood had taken ecstasy and died in hospital a few days later , leading to extensive media exposure on the correlation of drug culture and its links to the rave scene in Australia .
==== 2000s–present ==== The tradition continued in Melbourne , with 'Earthcore ' parties .
Raves also became less underground as they were in the 1990s , and many were held at licensed venues well into the 2000s .
Despite this , rave parties of 1990s size became less common .
Nonetheless , the rave scene in Australia experienced a brief resurgence briefly up until 2010 .
During this period the resurfacing of the `` Melbourne Shuffle '' , a Melbourne club/rave dance style , became a YouTube trend and videos were uploaded .
The rave subculture in Melbourne was strengthened with the opening of clubs such as Bass Station and Hard Candy .
Melbourne helped keep raving culture alive with young people .

Stanley Allison `` Stan '' Rogers ( November 29 , 1949 – June 2 , 1983 ) was a Canadian folk musician and songwriter .
Rogers was noted for his rich , baritone voice and his finely crafted , traditional-sounding songs which were frequently inspired by Canadian history and the daily lives of working people , especially those from the fishing villages of the Maritime provinces and , later , the farms of the Canadian prairies and Great Lakes .
Rogers died in a fire aboard Air Canada Flight 797 on the ground at the Greater Cincinnati Airport at the age of 33 .
== Early life and musical development == Rogers was born in Hamilton , Ontario the eldest son of Nathan Allison `` Al '' and Valerie Rogers ( née Bushell ) , two Maritimers who had relocated to Ontario in search of work shortly after their marriage in July 1948 .
Although Rogers was raised in Woodburn , Ontario ( a community in the easternmost part of Hamilton ) , he often spent summers visiting family in Guysborough County , Nova Scotia .
It was there that he became familiar with the way of life in the Maritimes , an influence which was to have a profound impact on his subsequent musical development .
He was interested in music from an early age , reportedly beginning to sing shortly after learning to speak .
He received his first guitar , hand-built by his uncle Lee Bushell , when he was five years of age .
He was exposed to a variety of music influences , but among the most lasting were the country and western tunes his uncles would sing during family get-togethers .
Throughout his childhood , he would practice his singing and playing along with his brother Garnet , six years his junior .
By the time that Rogers was attending Saltfleet High School in Stoney Creek , he started to meet other young people interested in folk music , although at this time he was also dabbling in rock and roll , singing and playing bass guitar in garage bands such as `` Stanley and the Living Stones '' and `` The Hobbits '' .
As a young man , Rogers briefly attended both McMaster University and Trent University .
Rogers signed with RCA Records in 1970 and recorded two singles : `` Here 's to You Santa Claus '' in 1970 , and `` The Fat Girl Rag '' in 1971 .
In 1973 Rogers recorded three singles for Polygram : `` Three Pennies '' , `` Guysborough Train '' and `` Past Fifty .
`` In 1976 , Rogers recorded his debut album , Fogarty 's Cove , released in 1977 on Barnswallow Records .
The album 's subject matter dealt almost entirely with life in maritime Canada , and was an immediate success .
Rogers then formed Fogarty 's Cove Music , and bought Barnswallow during the production of Turnaround , allowing him to release his own albums .
Posthumously , additional albums were released .
Rogers ' songs often had a Celtic feel which was due , in part , to his frequent use of DADGAD guitar tuning .
He regularly used his William 'Grit ' Laskin built 12-string guitar in his performances .
His best-known pieces include `` Northwest Passage '' , `` Barrett 's Privateers '' , `` The Mary Ellen Carter '' , `` Make and Break Harbour '' , `` The Idiot '' , `` The Field Behind the Plow '' , `` Lies '' , `` Fogarty 's Cove '' , `` White Squall '' , and `` Forty-Five Years '' .
== Death == Rogers died alongside 22 other passengers most likely of smoke inhalation on June 2 , 1983 , while traveling on Air Canada Flight 797 ( a McDonnell Douglas DC-9 ) after performing at the Kerrville Folk Festival .
The airliner was flying from Dallas , Texas to Toronto and Montreal when an in-flight fire forced it to make an emergency landing at the Greater Cincinnati Airport in northern Kentucky .
Smoke was filling the cabin from an unknown source , and once on the ground , the plane 's doors were opened to allow passengers to escape .
Approximately 60 to 90 seconds into the evacuation of the plane , the oxygen rushing in from outside caused a flash fire .
Rogers was one of the passengers still on the plane at the time of the fire .
His ashes were scattered in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Nova Scotia .
== Legacy == Rogers ' legacy includes his recordings , songbook , and plays for which he was commissioned to write music .
His songs are still frequently covered by other musicians , and are perennial favourites at Canadian campfires and song circles .
Members of Rogers ' band , including his brother Garnet Rogers , continue to be active performers and form a significant part of the fabric of contemporary Canadian folk music .
Following his death , he was nominated for the 1984 Juno Awards in the category for Best Male Vocalist .
In 1994 , his posthumous live album Home in Halifax was likewise nominated for Best Roots and Traditional Album .
His widow , Ariel , continues to oversee his estate and legacy .
His music and lyrics have been featured in numerous written publications and films .
For instance , his lyrics have appeared in school poetry books , taking their place alongside acknowledged classics .
His song `` Northwest Passage '' was featured in the last episode of the TV show Due South , his songs `` Barrett 's Privateers '' and `` Watching the Apples Grow '' having been previously featured .
`` Barrett 's Privateers '' has also been used extensively in promotion ads for Alexander Keith 's ale .
In the 2005 CTV made-for-TV movie on the life of Terry Fox , Rogers ' `` Turnaround '' is the music over the closing shot .
As the movie ends , Fox is depicted , alone , striding up a hill , while the lyric `` And yours was the open road .
The bitter song / The heavy load that I 'll never share , tho ' the offer 's still there / Every time you turn around , '' forges a link between these Canadian icons .
Many of his songs on the albums Northwest Passage and From Fresh Water refer to events in Canadian history .
Adrienne Clarkson , who , prior to serving as the Governor General of Canada from 1999 to 2005 , had worked for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation , highlighted Rogers ' career in a 1989 television documentary called One Warm Line on CBC Television ; she also quoted Rogers in her investitural address .
When CBC 's Peter Gzowski asked Canadians to pick an alternate national anthem , `` Northwest Passage '' was the overwhelming choice .
The Stan Rogers Folk Festival is held every year in Canso , Nova Scotia .
In 1995 , several artists performed two nights of concerts at Halifax 's Rebecca Cohn Auditorium , which were released on album that year as Remembering Stan Rogers .
Rogers is also a lasting fixture of the Canadian folk festival Summerfolk , held annually in Owen Sound , Ontario , where the main stage and amphitheater are dedicated as the `` Stan Rogers Memorial Canopy '' .
The festival is firmly fixed in tradition , with Rogers ' song `` The Mary Ellen Carter '' being sung by all involved , including the audience and a medley of acts at the festival .
At The Canmore Folk Festival , Alberta 's longest running folk music festival , performers take to the Stan Rogers Memorial Stage , which is the festival 's main stage .
Stan 's son , Nathan Rogers , is also an established Canadian folk artist with a voice and lyrical acumen similar to his father 's .
He has released two critically acclaimed solo discs and tours internationally as a solo act and in the trio Dry Bones .
In 2007 , Rogers was recognized posthumously with a National Achievement Award at the annual SOCAN Awards held in Toronto .
In 2013 , Groundwood Books turned Rogers ' song Northwest Passage into a children 's book illustrated by award-winning artist Matt James .

The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960 .
With members John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison and Ringo Starr , they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era .
Rooted in skiffle , beat and 1950s rock and roll , the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles , ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock , often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways .
In 1963 their enormous popularity first emerged as `` Beatlemania '' , and as the group 's music grew in sophistication in subsequent years , led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney , they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s .
The Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960 , with Stuart Sutcliffe initially serving as bass player .
The core of Lennon , McCartney and Harrison went through a succession of drummers , including Pete Best , before asking Starr to join them in 1962 .
Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act , and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings , greatly expanding their popularity in the United Kingdom after their first hit , `` Love Me Do '' , in late 1962 .
They acquired the nickname `` the Fab Four '' as Beatlemania grew in Britain the next year , and by early 1964 became international stars , leading the `` British Invasion '' of the United States pop market .
From 1965 onwards , the Beatles produced increasingly innovative recordings , including the albums Rubber Soul ( 1965 ) , Revolver ( 1966 ) , Sgt .
Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band ( 1967 ) , The Beatles ( commonly known as the White Album , 1968 ) and Abbey Road ( 1969 ) .
After their break-up in 1970 , they each enjoyed successful musical careers of varying lengths .
McCartney and Starr , the surviving members , remain musically active .
Lennon was shot and killed in December 1980 , and Harrison died of lung cancer in November 2001 .
The Beatles are the best-selling band in history , with estimated sales of over 800 million physical and digital albums worldwide .
They have had more number-one albums on the British charts and sold more singles in the UK than any other act .
They are also the best-selling music artists in the United States , with 178 million certified units .
In 2008 , the group topped Billboard magazine 's list of the all-time most successful artists ; as of 2017 , they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Hot 100 chart with twenty .
They have received seven Grammy Awards , an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards .
The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 , and all four main members were inducted individually from 1994 to 2015 .
They were also collectively included in Time magazine 's compilation of the twentieth century 's 100 most influential people .
== History == === 1957–1962 : Formation , Hamburg , and UK popularity === In March 1957 , John Lennon , then aged sixteen , formed a skiffle group with several friends from Quarry Bank High School .
They briefly called themselves the Blackjacks , before changing their name to the Quarrymen after discovering that a respected local group was already using the other name .
Fifteen-year-old Paul McCartney joined as a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and Lennon met that July .
In February 1958 , McCartney invited his friend George Harrison to watch the band .
The fifteen-year-old auditioned for Lennon , impressing him with his playing , but Lennon initially thought Harrison was too young to join them .
After a month of Harrison 's persistence , during a second meeting , arranged by McCartney , he performed the lead guitar part for the instrumental `` Raunchy '' on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus , and they enlisted him as their lead guitarist .
By January 1959 , Lennon 's Quarry Bank friends had left the group , and he began studies at the Liverpool College of Art .
The three guitarists , billing themselves at least three times as Johnny and the Moondogs , were playing rock and roll whenever they could find a drummer .
Lennon 's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe , who had recently sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar , joined in January 1960 , and it was he who suggested changing the band 's name to Beatals , as a tribute to Buddy Holly and the Crickets .
They used the name until May , when they became the Silver Beetles , before undertaking a brief tour of Scotland as the backing group for pop singer and fellow Liverpudlian Johnny Gentle .
By early July , they had changed their name to the Silver Beatles and by the middle of August to the Beatles .
Allan Williams , the Beatles ' unofficial manager , arranged a residency for them in Hamburg , but lacking a full-time drummer they auditioned and hired Pete Best in mid-August 1960 .
The band , now a five-piece , left four days later , contracted to club owner Bruno Koschmider for what would be a 3½-month residency .
Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn writes : `` They pulled into Hamburg at dusk on 17 August , the time when the red-light area comes to life ... flashing neon lights screamed out the various entertainment on offer , while scantily clad women sat unabashed in shop windows waiting for business opportunities .
`` Koschmider had converted a couple of strip clubs in the district into music venues , and he initially placed the Beatles at the Indra Club .
After closing the Indra due to noise complaints , he moved them to the Kaiserkeller in October .
When he learned they had been performing at the rival Top Ten Club in breach of their contract , he gave the band one month 's termination notice , and reported the underage Harrison , who had obtained permission to stay in Hamburg by lying to the German authorities about his age .
The authorities arranged for Harrison 's deportation in late November .
One week later , Koschmider had McCartney and Best arrested for arson after they set fire to a condom in a concrete corridor ; the authorities deported them .
Lennon returned to Liverpool in early December , while Sutcliffe remained in Hamburg until late February with his German fiancée Astrid Kirchherr , who took the first semi-professional photos of the Beatles .
During the next two years , the Beatles were resident for periods in Hamburg , where they used Preludin both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances .
In 1961 , during their second Hamburg engagement , Kirchherr cut Sutcliffe 's hair in the `` exi '' ( existentialist ) style , later adopted by the other Beatles .
When Sutcliffe decided to leave the band early that year and resume his art studies in Germany , McCartney took up the bass .
Producer Bert Kaempfert contracted what was now a four-piece group until June 1962 , and he used them as Tony Sheridan 's backing band on a series of recordings for Polydor Records .
As part of the sessions , the Beatles were signed to Polydor for one year .
Credited to `` Tony Sheridan & the Beat Brothers '' , the single `` My Bonnie '' , recorded in June 1961 and released four months later , reached number 32 on the Musikmarkt chart .
After the Beatles completed their second Hamburg residency , they enjoyed increasing popularity in Liverpool with the growing Merseybeat movement .
However , they were also growing tired of the monotony of numerous appearances at the same clubs night after night .
In November 1961 , during one of the group 's frequent performances at The Cavern Club , they encountered Brian Epstein , a local record-store owner and music columnist .
He later recalled : `` I immediately liked what I heard .
They were fresh , and they were honest , and they had what I thought was a sort of presence ... [ a ] star quality .
`` Epstein courted the band over the next couple of months , and they appointed him as their manager in January 1962 .
Throughout early and mid-1962 , Epstein sought to free the Beatles from their contractual obligations to Bert Kaempfert Productions .
He eventually negotiated a one-month-early release from their contract in exchange for one last recording session in Hamburg .
Tragedy greeted them on their return to Germany in April , when a distraught Kirchherr met them at the airport with news of Sutcliffe 's death the previous day from what would later be determined to have been a brain hemorrhage .
Epstein began negotiations with record labels for a recording contract .
In order to secure a UK record contract , Epstein negotiated an early end to the band 's contract with Polydor , in exchange for more recordings backing Tony Sheridan .
After a New Year 's Day audition , Decca Records rejected the band with the comment `` Guitar groups are on the way out , Mr .
Epstein .
`` However , three months later , producer George Martin signed the Beatles to EMI 's Parlophone label .
Martin 's first recording session with the Beatles took place at EMI 's Abbey Road Studios in London on 6 June 1962 .
Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best 's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place .
Already contemplating Best 's dismissal , the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr , who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them .
A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of `` Love Me Do '' featuring Starr on drums , but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band 's third session a week later , which produced recordings of `` Love Me Do '' , `` Please Please Me '' and `` P.S .
I Love You '' .
Martin initially selected the Starr version of `` Love Me Do '' for the band 's first single , though subsequent re-pressings featured the White version , with Starr on tambourine .
Released in early October , `` Love Me Do '' peaked at number seventeen on the Record Retailer chart .
Their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme People and Places .
After Martin suggested rerecording `` Please Please Me '' at a faster tempo , a studio session in late November yielded that recording , of which Martin accurately predicted , `` You 've just made your first No.1 .
`` In December 1962 , the Beatles concluded their fifth and final Hamburg residency .
By 1963 , they had agreed that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr , despite his restricted vocal range , to validate his standing in the group .
Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership , and as the band 's success grew , their dominant collaboration limited Harrison 's opportunities as a lead vocalist .
Epstein , in an effort to maximise the Beatles ' commercial potential , encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing .
Lennon recalled him saying , `` Look , if you really want to get in these bigger places , you 're going to have to change – stop eating on stage , stop swearing , stop smoking ... '' Lennon said : `` We used to dress how we liked , on and off stage .
He 'd tell us that jeans were not particularly smart and could we possibly manage to wear proper trousers , but he did n't want us suddenly looking square .
He 'd let us have our own sense of individuality .
`` === 1963–1966 : Beatlemania and touring years === ==== Please Please Me and With the Beatles ==== On 11 February 1963 , the Beatles recorded ten songs during a single studio session for their debut LP , Please Please Me .
The album was supplemented by the four tracks already released on their first two singles .
Martin originally considered recording the Beatles ' debut LP live at The Cavern Club , but after deciding that the building 's acoustics were inadequate , he elected to simulate a `` live '' album with minimal production in `` a single marathon session at Abbey Road '' .
After the moderate success of `` Love Me Do '' , the single `` Please Please Me '' met with a more emphatic reception .
Released in January 1963 , two months ahead of the album of the same name , the song reached number one on every chart in London except Record Retailer , where it stalled at number two .
Recalling how the Beatles `` rushed to deliver a debut album , bashing out Please Please Me in a day '' , AllMusic 's Stephen Thomas Erlewine comments , `` Decades after its release , the album still sounds fresh , precisely because of its intense origins .
`` Lennon said little thought went into composition at the time ; he and McCartney were `` just writing songs à la Everly Brothers , à la Buddy Holly , pop songs with no more thought of them than that – to create a sound .
And the words were almost irrelevant .
`` Released in March 1963 , the album initiated a run during which eleven of their twelve studio albums released in the United Kingdom through 1970 reached number one .
The band 's third single , `` From Me to You '' , came out in April and was also a chart-topping hit , starting an almost unbroken string of seventeen British number-one singles for the Beatles , including all but one of the eighteen they released over the next six years .
Issued in August , the band 's fourth single , `` She Loves You '' , achieved the fastest sales of any record in the UK up to that time , selling three-quarters of a million copies in under four weeks .
It became their first single to sell a million copies , and remained the biggest-selling record in the UK until 1978 .
Their commercial success brought increased media exposure , to which the Beatles responded with an irreverent and comical attitude that defied the expectations of pop musicians at the time , inspiring even more interest .
The band toured the UK three times in the first half of the year : a four-week tour that began in February , the Beatles 's first nationwide , preceded three-week tours in March and May–June .
As their popularity spread , a frenzied adulation of the group took hold .
Greeted with riotous enthusiasm by screaming fans , the press dubbed the phenomenon `` Beatlemania '' .
Although not billed as tour leaders , the Beatles overshadowed American acts Tommy Roe and Chris Montez during the February engagements and assumed top billing `` by audience demand '' , something no British act had previously accomplished while touring with artists from the US .
A similar situation arose during their May–June tour with Roy Orbison .
In late October , the Beatles began a five-day tour of Sweden , their first time abroad since the final Hamburg engagement of December 1962 .
On their return to the UK on 31 October , according to Lewisohn , `` several hundred screaming fans '' greeted them in heavy rain at Heathrow Airport .
Around 50 to 100 journalists and photographers as well as representatives from the BBC also joined the airport reception , the first of more than 100 such events .
The next day , the band began its fourth tour of Britain within nine months , this one scheduled for six weeks .
In mid-November , as Beatlemania intensified , police resorted to using high-pressure water hoses to control the crowd before a concert in Plymouth .
Please Please Me maintained the top position on the Record Retailer chart for 30 weeks , only to be displaced by its follow-up , With the Beatles , which EMI released on 22 November to record advance orders of 270,000 copies .
The LP topped a half-million albums sold in one week .
Recorded between July and October , With the Beatles made better use of studio production techniques than its predecessor .
It held the top spot for 21 weeks with a chart life of 40 weeks .
Erlewine described the LP as `` a sequel of the highest order – one that betters the original '' .
In a reversal of then standard practice , EMI released the album ahead of the impending single `` I Want to Hold Your Hand '' , with the song excluded to maximise the single 's sales .
The album caught the attention of music critic William Mann of The Times , who suggested that Lennon and McCartney were `` the outstanding English composers of 1963 '' .
The newspaper published a series of articles in which Mann offered detailed analyses of the music , lending it respectability .
With the Beatles became the second album in UK chart history to sell a million copies , a figure previously reached only by the 1958 South Pacific soundtrack .
When writing the sleeve notes for the album , the band 's press officer , Tony Barrow , used the superlative the `` fabulous foursome '' , which the media widely adopted as `` the Fab Four '' .
==== `` British Invasion '' ==== EMI 's American subsidiary , Capitol Records , hindered the Beatles ' releases in the United States for more than a year by initially declining to issue their music , including their first three singles .
Concurrent negotiations with the independent US label Vee-Jay led to the release of some of the songs in 1963 , but not all .
Vee-Jay finished preparation for the album Introducing ...
The Beatles , culled from most of the songs of Parlophone 's Please Please Me , but a management shake-up led to the album not being released .
Then when it surfaced that the label did not report royalties on their sales , the licence Vee-Jay signed with EMI was voided .
A new licence was granted to the Swan label for the single `` She Loves You '' .
The record received some airplay in the Tidewater area of Virginia by Gene Loving of radio station WGH and was featured on the `` Rate-a-Record '' segment of American Bandstand , but it failed to catch on nationally .
Epstein arranged for a $ 40,000 US marketing campaign .
American chart success began after disc jockey Carroll James of AM radio station WWDC ( now WWRC ) in Washington , DC first played `` I Want to Hold Your Hand '' in mid-December 1963 .
It was not until the end of the first week of January 1964 that their records were played in New York City ( also accompanied by a major marketing campaign and with similar play frequency ) , and then the rest of the country , initiating their music 's spread across US radio .
This caused an increase in demand , leading Capitol to rush-release `` I Want to Hold Your Hand '' later that month .
Issued on 26 December 1963 , with the band 's previously scheduled debut there just weeks away , `` I Want to Hold Your Hand '' sold a million copies , becoming a number-one hit in the US by mid-January .
In its wake , Vee-Jay released Introducing ...
The Beatles to go along with Capitol 's debut album , Meet the Beatles ! , while Swan reactivated production of `` She Loves You '' .
On 7 February 1964 , the Beatles left the United Kingdom with an estimated 4,000 fans gathered at Heathrow , waving and screaming as the aircraft took off .
Upon landing at New York 's John F. Kennedy Airport , an uproarious crowd estimated at 3,000 greeted them .
They gave their first live US television performance two days later on The Ed Sullivan Show , watched by approximately 73 million viewers in over 23 million households , or 34 per cent of the American population .
Biographer Jonathan Gould writes that , according to the Nielsen rating service , it was `` the largest audience that had ever been recorded for an American television program '' .
The next morning , the Beatles awoke to a negative critical consensus in the US , but a day later their first US concert saw Beatlemania erupt at Washington Coliseum .
Back in New York the following day , the Beatles met with another strong reception during two shows at Carnegie Hall .
The band then flew to Florida and appeared on the weekly Ed Sullivan Show a second time , before another 70 million viewers , before returning to the UK on 22 February .
==== A Hard Day 's Night ==== Capitol Records ' lack of interest throughout 1963 had not gone unnoticed , and a competitor , United Artists Records , encouraged their film division to offer the group a three-motion-picture deal , primarily for the commercial potential of the soundtracks .
Directed by Richard Lester , A Hard Day 's Night involved the band for six weeks in March–April 1964 as they played themselves in a mock-documentary .
The film premiered in London and New York in July and August , respectively , and was an international success , with some critics drawing comparison with the Marx Brothers .
According to Erlewine , the accompanying soundtrack album , A Hard Day 's Night , saw them `` truly coming into their own as a band .
All of the disparate influences on their first two albums had coalesced into a bright , joyous , original sound , filled with ringing guitars and irresistible melodies .
`` That `` ringing guitar '' sound was primarily the product of Harrison 's 12-string electric Rickenbacker , a prototype given to him by the manufacturer , which made its debut on the record .
During the week of 4 April 1964 , the Beatles held twelve positions on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart , including the top five .
Their popularity generated unprecedented interest in British music , and a number of other UK acts subsequently made their own American debuts , successfully touring over the next three years in what was termed the British Invasion .
Their hairstyle , unusually long for the era and mocked by many adults , became an emblem of rebellion to the burgeoning youth culture .
Touring internationally in June and July , the Beatles staged 37 shows over 27 days in Denmark , the Netherlands , Hong Kong , Australia and New Zealand .
In August they returned to the US , with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities .
Generating intense interest once again , the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York .
In August , journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan .
Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite , Dylan introduced them to cannabis .
Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting , before which the musicians ' respective fanbases were `` perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds '' : Dylan 's audience of `` college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings , a dawning political and social idealism , and a mildly bohemian style '' contrasted with their fans , `` veritable 'teenyboppers ' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television , radio , pop records , fan magazines , and teen fashion .
They were seen as idolaters , not idealists .
`` Within six months of the meeting , Gould writes , `` Lennon would be making records on which he openly imitated Dylan 's nasal drone , brittle strum , and introspective vocal persona '' .
Within a year , `` the distinctions between the folk and rock audiences would have nearly evaporated [ and the group 's ] audience ... [ was ] showing signs of growing up .
`` ==== Beatles for Sale , Help !
and Rubber Soul ==== According to Gould , Beatles for Sale , the Beatles ' fourth studio LP , evidenced a growing conflict between the commercial pressures of their global success and their creative ambitions .
They had intended the album , recorded between August and October 1964 , to continue the format established by A Hard Day 's Night which , unlike their first two LPs , contained only original songs .
They had nearly exhausted their backlog of songs on the previous album , however , and given the challenges constant international touring posed to their songwriting efforts , Lennon admitted , `` Material 's becoming a hell of a problem '' .
As a result , six covers from their extensive repertoire were chosen to complete the album .
Released in early December , its eight original compositions stood out , demonstrating the growing maturity of the Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership .
In early 1965 , while they were his guests for dinner , Lennon and Harrison 's dentist secretly added LSD to their coffee .
Lennon described the experience : `` It was just terrifying , but it was fantastic .
I was pretty stunned for a month or two .
`` He and Harrison subsequently became regular users of the drug , joined by Starr on at least one occasion .
McCartney was initially reluctant to try it , but eventually did so in late 1966 .
He became the first Beatle to discuss LSD publicly , declaring in a magazine interview that `` it opened my eyes '' and `` made me a better , more honest , more tolerant member of society '' .
Controversy erupted in June 1965 when Queen Elizabeth II appointed all four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire ( MBE ) after Prime Minister Harold Wilson nominated them for the award .
In protest – the honour was at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders – some conservative MBE recipients returned their own insignia .
Released in July , the Beatles ' second film , Help ! , was again directed by Lester .
Described as `` mainly a relentless spoof of Bond '' , it inspired a mixed response among both reviewers and the band .
McCartney said : `` Help !
was great but it was n't our film – we were sort of guest stars .
It was fun , but basically , as an idea for a film , it was a bit wrong .
`` The soundtrack was dominated by Lennon , who wrote and sang lead on most of its songs , including the two singles : `` Help !
`` and `` Ticket to Ride '' .
The accompanying album , the group 's fifth studio LP , contained all original material save for two covers , `` Act Naturally '' and `` Dizzy Miss Lizzy '' ; they were the last covers the band would include on an album , with the exception of Let It Be 's brief rendition of the traditional Liverpool folk song `` Maggie Mae '' .
The band expanded their use of vocal overdubs on Help !
and incorporated classical instruments into some arrangements , including a string quartet on the pop ballad `` Yesterday '' .
Composed by McCartney , `` Yesterday '' would inspire the most recorded cover versions of any song ever written .
The group 's third US tour opened with a performance before a world-record crowd of 55,600 at New York 's Shea Stadium on 15 August 1965 – `` perhaps the most famous of all Beatles ' concerts '' , in Lewisohn 's description .
A further nine successful concerts followed in other American cities .
At a show in Atlanta , the Beatles gave one of the first live performances ever to make use of a foldback system of on-stage monitor speakers .
Towards the end of the tour , they met with Elvis Presley , a foundational musical influence on the band , who invited them to his home in Beverly Hills .
September saw the launch of an American Saturday-morning cartoon series , The Beatles , that echoed A Hard Day 's Night 's slapstick antics over its two-year original run .
The series was a historical milestone as the first weekly television series to feature animated versions of real , living people .
In mid-October 1965 , the Beatles entered the recording studio ; for the first time when making an album , they had an extended period without other major commitments .
Until this time , according to George Martin , `` we had been making albums rather like a collection of singles .
Now we were really beginning to think about albums as a bit of art on their own .
`` Released in December , Rubber Soul has been hailed by critics as a major step forward in the maturity and complexity of the band 's music .
Their thematic reach was beginning to expand as they embraced deeper aspects of romance and philosophy .
Biographers Peter Brown and Steven Gaines attribute the new musical direction to `` the Beatles ' now habitual use of marijuana '' , an assertion confirmed by the band – Lennon referred to it as `` the pot album '' , and Starr said : `` Grass was really influential in a lot of our changes , especially with the writers .
And because they were writing different material , we were playing differently .
`` After Help !
's foray into the world of classical music with flutes and strings , Harrison 's introduction of a sitar on `` Norwegian Wood ( This Bird Has Flown ) '' marked a further progression outside the traditional boundaries of popular music .
As their lyrics grew more artful , fans began to study them for deeper meaning .
Of `` Norwegian Wood '' Lennon commented : `` I was trying to be sophisticated in writing about an affair ... but in such a smokescreen way that you could n't tell .
`` While many of Rubber Soul 's prominent songs were the product of Lennon and McCartney 's collaborative songwriting , it also featured distinct compositions from each , though they continued to share official credit .
The song `` In My Life '' , of which each later claimed lead authorship , is considered a highlight of the entire Lennon–McCartney catalogue .
Harrison called Rubber Soul his `` favourite album '' and Starr referred to it as `` the departure record '' .
McCartney has said , `` We 'd had our cute period , and now it was time to expand .
`` However , recording engineer Norman Smith later stated that the studio sessions revealed signs of growing conflict within the group – `` the clash between John and Paul was becoming obvious '' , he wrote , and `` as far as Paul was concerned , George could do no right '' .
In 2003 , Rolling Stone ranked Rubber Soul fifth among `` The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time '' , and AllMusic 's Richie Unterberger describes it as `` one of the classic folk-rock records '' .
==== Controversy , final tour and Revolver ==== Capitol Records , from December 1963 when it began issuing Beatles recordings for the US market , exercised complete control over format , compiling distinct US albums from the band 's recordings and issuing songs of their choosing as singles .
In June 1966 , Yesterday and Today , one of Capitol 's compilation albums , caused an uproar with its cover , which portrayed the grinning Beatles dressed in butcher 's overalls , accompanied by raw meat and mutilated plastic baby dolls .
It has been incorrectly suggested that this was meant as a satirical response to the way Capitol had `` butchered '' the US versions of their albums .
Thousands of copies of the LP had a new cover pasted over the original ; an unpeeled `` first-state '' copy fetched $ 10,500 at a December 2005 auction .
In England , meanwhile , Harrison met sitar maestro Ravi Shankar , who agreed to train him on the instrument .
During a tour of the Philippines the month after the Yesterday and Today furore , the Beatles unintentionally snubbed the nation 's first lady , Imelda Marcos , who had expected them to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace .
When presented with the invitation , Epstein politely declined on the band members ' behalf , as it had never been his policy to accept such official invitations .
They soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to taking no for an answer .
The resulting riots endangered the group and they escaped the country with difficulty .
Immediately afterwards , the band members visited India for the first time .
Almost as soon as they returned home , the Beatles faced a fierce backlash from US religious and social conservatives ( as well as the Ku Klux Klan ) over a comment Lennon had made in a March interview with British reporter Maureen Cleave .
`` Christianity will go , '' Lennon had said .
`` It will vanish and shrink .
I need n't argue about that ; I 'm right and I will be proved right .
... Jesus was alright but his disciples were thick and ordinary .
It 's them twisting it that ruins it for me .
`` The comment went virtually unnoticed in England , but when US teenage fan magazine Datebook printed it five months later – on the eve of the group 's August US tour – it sparked a controversy with Christians in the American `` Bible Belt '' .
The Vatican issued a protest , and bans on Beatles ' records were imposed by Spanish and Dutch stations and South Africa 's national broadcasting service .
Epstein accused Datebook of having taken Lennon 's words out of context ; at a press conference Lennon pointed out , `` If I 'd said television was more popular than Jesus , I might have got away with it .
`` Lennon claimed that he was referring to how other people viewed their success , but at the prompting of reporters , he concluded : `` If you want me to apologise , if that will make you happy , then okay , I 'm sorry .
`` As preparations were made for the US tour , the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard .
Having originally used Vox AC30 amplifiers , they later acquired more powerful 100-watt amplifiers , specially designed by Vox for them as they moved into larger venues in 1964 , but these were still inadequate .
Struggling to compete with the volume of sound generated by screaming fans , the band had grown increasingly bored with the routine of performing live .
Recognising that their shows were no longer about the music , they decided to make the August tour their last .
Rubber Soul had marked a major step forward ; Revolver , released in August 1966 a week before the Beatles ' final tour , marked another .
Pitchfork 's Scott Plagenhoef identifies it as `` the sound of a band growing into supreme confidence '' and `` redefining what was expected from popular music '' .
Revolver featured sophisticated songwriting , studio experimentation , and a greatly expanded repertoire of musical styles , ranging from innovative classical string arrangements to psychedelic rock .
Abandoning the customary group photograph , its cover – designed by Klaus Voormann , a friend of the band since their Hamburg days – `` was a stark , arty , black-and-white collage that caricatured the Beatles in a pen-and-ink style beholden to Aubrey Beardsley '' , in Gould 's description .
The album was preceded by the single `` Paperback Writer '' , backed by `` Rain '' .
Short promotional films were made for both songs ; described by cultural historian Saul Austerlitz as `` among the first true music videos '' , they aired on The Ed Sullivan Show and Top of the Pops in June 1966 .
Among the experimental songs that Revolver featured was `` Tomorrow Never Knows '' , the lyrics for which Lennon drew from Timothy Leary 's The Psychedelic Experience : A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead .
Its creation involved eight tape decks distributed about the EMI building , each staffed by an engineer or band member , who randomly varied the movement of a tape loop while Martin created a composite recording by sampling the incoming data .
McCartney 's `` Eleanor Rigby '' made prominent use of a string octet ; Gould describes it as `` a true hybrid , conforming to no recognisable style or genre of song '' .
Harrison was developing as a songwriter , and three of his compositions earned a place on the record .
In 2003 , Rolling Stone ranked Revolver as the third greatest album of all time .
During the US tour that followed its release , however , the band performed none of its songs .
As Chris Ingham writes , they were very much `` studio creations ... and there was no way a four-piece rock 'n ' roll group could do them justice , particularly through the desensitising wall of the fans ' screams .
'Live Beatles ' and 'Studio Beatles ' had become entirely different beasts .
`` The band 's final concert at San Francisco 's Candlestick Park on 29 August was their last commercial concert .
It marked the end of a four-year period dominated by almost nonstop touring that included over 1,400 concert appearances internationally .
=== 1966–1970 : Studio years and break-up === ==== Sgt .
Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band ==== Freed from the burden of touring , the Beatles embraced an increasingly experimental approach as they recorded Sgt .
Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , beginning in late November 1966 .
According to engineer Geoff Emerick , the album 's recording took over 700 hours .
He recalled the band 's insistence `` that everything on Sgt .
Pepper had to be different .
We had microphones right down in the bells of brass instruments and headphones turned into microphones attached to violins .
We used giant primitive oscillators to vary the speed of instruments and vocals and we had tapes chopped to pieces and stuck together upside down and the wrong way around .
`` Parts of `` A Day in the Life '' featured a 40-piece orchestra .
The sessions initially yielded the non-album double A-side single `` Strawberry Fields Forever '' / '' Penny Lane '' in February 1967 ; the Sgt .
Pepper LP followed in June .
The musical complexity of the records , created using relatively primitive four-track recording technology , astounded contemporary artists .
Among music critics , acclaim for the album was virtually universal .
Gould writes : The overwhelming consensus is that the Beatles had created a popular masterpiece : a rich , sustained , and overflowing work of collaborative genius whose bold ambition and startling originality dramatically enlarged the possibilities and raised the expectations of what the experience of listening to popular music on record could be .
On the basis of this perception , Sgt .
Pepper became the catalyst for an explosion of mass enthusiasm for album-formatted rock that would revolutionise both the aesthetics and the economics of the record business in ways that far outstripped the earlier pop explosions triggered by the Elvis phenomenon of 1956 and the Beatlemania phenomenon of 1963 .
Sgt .
Pepper was the first major pop/rock LP to include its complete lyrics , which appeared on the back cover .
Those lyrics were the subject of critical analysis ; for instance , in late 1967 the album was the subject of a scholarly inquiry by American literary critic and professor of English Richard Poirier , who observed that his students were `` listening to the group 's music with a degree of engagement that he , as a teacher of literature , could only envy '' .
Poirier identified what he termed its `` mixed allusiveness '' : `` It 's unwise ever to assume that they 're doing only one thing or expressing themselves in only one style ... one kind of feeling about a subject is n't enough ... any single induced feeling must often exist within the context of seemingly contradictory alternatives .
`` McCartney said at the time : `` We write songs .
We know what we mean by them .
But in a week someone else says something about it , and you ca n't deny it .
... You put your own meaning at your own level to our songs .
`` The album 's elaborate cover also attracted considerable interest and study .
A collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth , it depicted the group as the fictional band referred to in the album 's title track standing in front of a crowd of famous people .
The heavy moustaches worn by the group reflected the growing influence of hippie style , while cultural historian Jonathan Harris describes their `` brightly coloured parodies of military uniforms '' as a knowingly `` anti-authoritarian and anti-establishment '' display .
In 2003 , Rolling Stone ranked it number one on its list of the `` 500 Greatest Albums of All Time '' .
On 25 June 1967 , the Beatles performed their forthcoming single , `` All You Need Is Love '' , to an estimated 350 million viewers on Our World , the first live global television link .
Released a week later , during the Summer of Love , the song was adopted as a flower power anthem .
Two months later , the group suffered a loss that threw their career into turmoil .
Having been introduced to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi only the previous night in London , on 25 August they travelled to Bangor for his Transcendental Meditation retreat .
Two days later , their manager 's assistant , Peter Brown , phoned to inform them that Epstein , only thirty-two years old , had died .
The coroner ruled the death an accidental carbitol overdose , although it was widely rumoured to be a suicide .
Epstein had been in a fragile emotional state , stressed by personal issues .
His death left the group disoriented and fearful about the future .
Lennon recalled : `` We collapsed .
I knew that we were in trouble then .
I did n't really have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music , and I was scared .
I thought , 'We 've had it now .
' '' ==== Magical Mystery Tour , the White Album and Yellow Submarine ==== Magical Mystery Tour , the soundtrack to a forthcoming Beatles television film , was released in the UK as a six-track double extended play disc ( EP ) in early December 1967 .
In the United States , the six songs were issued on an identically titled LP that also included five tracks from the band 's recent singles .
Unterberger says of the US Magical Mystery Tour , `` the psychedelic sound is very much in the vein of Sgt .
Pepper , and even spacier in parts ( especially the sound collages of 'I Am the Walrus ' ) '' and he calls its five songs culled from the band 's 1967 singles `` huge , glorious , and innovative '' .
In its first three weeks , the album set a record for the highest initial sales of any Capitol LP , and it is the only Capitol compilation later to be adopted in the band 's official canon of studio albums .
First aired on Boxing Day , the Magical Mystery Tour film , largely directed by McCartney , brought the group their first major negative UK press .
It was dismissed as `` blatant rubbish '' by the Daily Express ; the Daily Mail called it `` a colossal conceit '' ; and The Guardian labelled the film `` a kind of fantasy morality play about the grossness and warmth and stupidity of the audience '' .
Gould describes it as `` a great deal of raw footage showing a group of people getting on , getting off , and riding on a bus '' .
Although the viewership figures were respectable , its slating in the press led US television networks to lose interest in broadcasting the film .
In January 1968 , the Beatles filmed a cameo for the animated movie Yellow Submarine , which featured cartoon versions of the band members and a soundtrack with eleven of their songs , including four unreleased studio recordings that made their debut in the film .
Released in June 1968 , the film was praised by critics for its music , humour and innovative visual style .
It would be seven months , however , before its soundtrack album appeared .
In the interim came The Beatles , a double LP commonly known as the White Album for its virtually featureless cover .
Creative inspiration for the album came from a new direction : without Epstein 's guiding presence , the group had briefly turned to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi as their guru .
At his ashram in Rishikesh , India , a `` Guide Course '' scheduled for three months marked one of their most prolific periods , yielding numerous songs including a majority of the 30 included on the album .
However , Starr left after only ten days , likening it to Butlins , and McCartney eventually grew bored and departed a month later .
For Lennon and Harrison , creativity turned to questioning when an electronics technician known as Magic Alex suggested that the Maharishi was attempting to manipulate them .
When he alleged that the Maharishi had made sexual advances to women attendees , a persuaded Lennon left abruptly just two months into the course , bringing an unconvinced Harrison and the remainder of the group 's entourage with him .
In anger , Lennon wrote a scathing song titled `` Maharishi '' , renamed `` Sexy Sadie '' to avoid potential legal issues .
McCartney said , `` We made a mistake .
We thought there was more to him than there was .
`` During recording sessions for the White Album , which stretched from late May to mid-October 1968 , relations between the Beatles grew openly divisive .
Starr quit for two weeks , and McCartney took over the drum kit for `` Back in the U.S.S.R. '' ( on which Harrison and Lennon drummed as well ) and `` Dear Prudence '' .
Lennon had lost interest in collaborating with McCartney , whose contribution `` Ob-La-Di , Ob-La-Da '' he scorned as `` granny music shit '' .
Tensions were further aggravated by Lennon 's romantic preoccupation with avant-garde artist Yoko Ono , whom he insisted on bringing to the sessions despite the group 's well-established understanding that girlfriends were not allowed in the studio .
Describing the double album , Lennon later said : `` Every track is an individual track ; there is n't any Beatle music on it .
[ It 's ] John and the band , Paul and the band , George and the band .
`` McCartney has recalled that the album `` was n't a pleasant one to make '' .
Both he and Lennon identified the sessions as the start of the band 's break-up .
Issued in November , the White Album was the band 's first Apple Records album release , although EMI continued to own their recordings .
The new label was a subsidiary of Apple Corps , which Epstein had formed as part of his plan to create a tax-effective business structure .
The record attracted more than 2 million advance orders , selling nearly 4 million copies in the US in little over a month , and its tracks dominated the playlists of American radio stations .
Despite its popularity , it did not receive flattering reviews at the time .
According to Gould : The critical response ... ranged from mixed to flat .
In marked contrast to Sgt .
Pepper , which had helped to establish an entire genre of literate rock criticism , the White Album inspired no critical writing of any note .
Even the most sympathetic reviewers ... clearly did n't know what to make of this shapeless outpouring of songs .
Newsweek 's Hubert Saal , citing the high proportion of parodies , accused the group of getting their tongues caught in their cheeks .
General critical opinion eventually turned in favour of the White Album , and in 2003 , Rolling Stone ranked it as the tenth greatest album of all time .
Pitchfork 's Mark Richardson describes it as `` large and sprawling , overflowing with ideas but also with indulgences , and filled with a hugely variable array of material ... its failings are as essential to its character as its triumphs .
`` Erlewine comments : `` The [ band 's ] two main songwriting forces were no longer on the same page , but neither were George and Ringo '' , yet `` Lennon turns in two of his best ballads '' , McCartney 's songs are `` stunning '' , Harrison had become `` a songwriter who deserved wider exposure '' , and Starr 's composition was `` a delight '' .
The Yellow Submarine LP , issued in January 1969 , contained only the four previously unreleased songs that had debuted in the film , along with the title track ( already issued on Revolver ) , `` All You Need Is Love '' ( already issued as a single and on the US Magical Mystery Tour LP ) and seven instrumental pieces composed by Martin .
Because of the paucity of new Beatles music , AllMusic 's Unterberger and Bruce Eder suggest the album might be `` inessential '' but for Harrison 's `` It 's All Too Much '' : `` the jewel of the new songs ... resplendent in swirling Mellotron , larger-than-life percussion , and tidal waves of feedback guitar ... a virtuoso excursion into otherwise hazy psychedelia '' .
==== Abbey Road , Let It Be and break-up ==== Although Let It Be was the Beatles ' final album release , it was largely recorded before Abbey Road .
The project 's impetus came from an idea Martin attributes to McCartney , who suggested they `` record an album of new material and rehearse it , then perform it before a live audience for the very first time – on record and on film '' .
Originally intended for a one-hour television programme to be called Beatles at Work , much of the album 's content came from extensive rehearsals filmed by director Michael Lindsay-Hogg at Twickenham Film Studios , beginning in January 1969 .
Martin has said that the project was `` not at all a happy recording experience .
It was a time when relations between the Beatles were at their lowest ebb .
`` Lennon described the largely impromptu sessions as `` hell ... the most miserable ... on Earth '' , and Harrison , `` the low of all-time '' .
Irritated by both McCartney and Lennon , Harrison walked out for five days .
Upon returning , he threatened to leave the band unless they `` abandon [ ed ] all talk of live performance '' and instead focused on finishing a new album , initially titled Get Back , using songs recorded for the TV special .
He also demanded they cease work at Twickenham and relocate to the newly finished Apple Studio .
The other band members agreed , and the idea came about to salvage the footage shot for the TV production for use in a feature film .
In an effort to alleviate tensions within the band and improve the quality of their live sound , Harrison invited keyboardist Billy Preston to participate in the last nine days of sessions .
Preston received label billing on the `` Get Back '' single – the only musician ever to receive that acknowledgment on an official Beatles release .
At the conclusion of the rehearsals , the band could not agree on a location to film a concert , rejecting several ideas , including a boat at sea , a lunatic asylum , the Tunisian desert , and the Colosseum .
Ultimately , what would be their final live performance was filmed on the rooftop of the Apple Corps building at 3 Savile Row , London , on 30 January 1969 .
Five weeks later , engineer Glyn Johns , whom Lewisohn describes as Get Back 's `` uncredited producer '' , began work assembling an album , given `` free rein '' as the band `` all but washed their hands of the entire project '' .
New strains developed between the band members regarding the appointment of a financial adviser , the need for which had become evident without Epstein to manage business affairs .
Lennon , Harrison and Starr favoured Allen Klein , who had managed the Rolling Stones and Sam Cooke ; McCartney wanted Lee and John Eastman – father and brother , respectively , of Linda Eastman , whom McCartney married on 12 March .
Agreement could not be reached , so both Klein and the Eastmans were temporarily appointed : Klein as the Beatles ' business manager and the Eastmans as their lawyers .
Further conflict ensued , however , and financial opportunities were lost .
On 8 May , Klein was named sole manager of the band , the Eastmans having previously been dismissed as the Beatles ' attorneys .
McCartney refused to sign the management contract with Klein , but he was out-voted by the other Beatles .
Martin stated that he was surprised when McCartney asked him to produce another album , as the Get Back sessions had been `` a miserable experience '' and he had `` thought it was the end of the road for all of us '' .
The primary recording sessions for Abbey Road began on 2 July 1969 .
Lennon , who rejected Martin 's proposed format of a `` continuously moving piece of music '' , wanted his and McCartney 's songs to occupy separate sides of the album .
The eventual format , with individually composed songs on the first side and the second consisting largely of a medley , was McCartney 's suggested compromise .
On 4 July , the first solo single by a Beatle was released : Lennon 's `` Give Peace a Chance '' , credited to the Plastic Ono Band .
The completion and mixing of `` I Want You ( She 's So Heavy ) '' on 20 August 1969 was the last occasion on which all four Beatles were together in the same studio .
Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September , but agreed to withhold a public announcement to avoid undermining sales of the forthcoming album .
Released six days after Lennon 's declaration , Abbey Road sold 4 million copies within three months and topped the UK charts for a total of seventeen weeks .
Its second track , the ballad `` Something '' , was issued as a single – the only Harrison composition ever to appear as a Beatles A-side .
Abbey Road received mixed reviews , although the medley met with general acclaim .
Unterberger considers it `` a fitting swan song for the group '' , containing `` some of the greatest harmonies to be heard on any rock record '' .
Musicologist and author Ian MacDonald calls the album `` erratic and often hollow '' , despite the `` semblance of unity and coherence '' offered by the medley .
Martin has singled it out as his personal favourite of all the band 's albums ; Lennon said it was `` competent '' but had `` no life in it '' .
Recording engineer Emerick notes that the replacement of the studio 's valve mixing console with a transistorised one yielded a less punchy sound , leaving the group frustrated at the thinner tone and lack of impact and contributing to its `` kinder , gentler '' feel relative to their previous albums .
For the still unfinished Get Back album , one last song , Harrison 's `` I Me Mine '' , was recorded on 3 January 1970 .
Lennon , in Denmark at the time , did not participate .
In March , rejecting the work Johns had done on the project , now retitled Let It Be , Klein gave the session tapes to American producer Phil Spector , who had recently produced Lennon 's solo single `` Instant Karma !
`` In addition to remixing the material , Spector edited , spliced and overdubbed several of the recordings that had been intended as `` live '' .
McCartney was unhappy with the producer 's approach and particularly dissatisfied with the lavish orchestration on `` The Long and Winding Road '' , which involved a fourteen-voice choir and 36-piece instrumental ensemble .
McCartney 's demands that the alterations to the song be reverted were ignored , and he publicly announced his departure from the band on 10 April 1970 , a week before the release of his first , self-titled solo album .
On 8 May , the Spector-produced Let It Be was released .
Its accompanying single , `` The Long and Winding Road '' , was the Beatles ' last ; it was released in the United States , but not in the UK .
The Let It Be documentary film followed later that month , and would win the 1970 Academy Award for Best Original Song Score .
Sunday Telegraph critic Penelope Gilliatt called it `` a very bad film and a touching one ... about the breaking apart of this reassuring , geometrically perfect , once apparently ageless family of siblings '' .
Several reviewers stated that some of the performances in the film sounded better than their analogous album tracks .
Describing Let It Be as the `` only Beatles album to occasion negative , even hostile reviews '' , Unterberger calls it `` on the whole underrated '' ; he singles out `` some good moments of straight hard rock in 'I 've Got a Feeling ' and 'Dig a Pony ' '' , and praises `` Let It Be '' , `` Get Back '' , and `` the folky 'Two of Us ' , with John and Paul harmonising together '' .
McCartney filed suit for the dissolution of the Beatles ' contractual partnership on 31 December 1970 .
Legal disputes continued long after their break-up , and the dissolution was not formalised until 29 December 1974 , when John Lennon signed the paperwork terminating the partnership while on vacation with his family at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida .
=== 1970–present : After the break-up === ==== 1970s ==== Lennon , McCartney , Harrison and Starr all released solo albums in 1970 .
Their solo records sometimes involved one or more of the others ; Starr 's Ringo ( 1973 ) was the only album to include compositions and performances by all four ex-Beatles , albeit on separate songs .
With Starr 's participation , Harrison staged the Concert for Bangladesh in New York City in August 1971 .
Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 , later bootlegged as A Toot and a Snore in '74 , Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again .
Two double-LP sets of the Beatles ' greatest hits , compiled by Klein , 1962–1966 and 1967–1970 , were released in 1973 , at first under the Apple Records imprint .
Commonly known as the Red Album and Blue Album , respectively , each have earned a Multi-Platinum certification in the United States and a Platinum certification in the United Kingdom .
Between 1976 and 1982 , EMI/Capitol released a wave of compilation albums without input from the ex-Beatles , starting with the double-disc compilation Rock 'n ' Roll Music .
The only one to feature previously unreleased material was The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl ( 1977 ) ; the first officially issued concert recordings by the group , it contained selections from two shows they played during their 1964 and 1965 US tours .
The music and enduring fame of the Beatles was commercially exploited in various other ways , again often outside their creative control .
In April 1974 , the musical John , Paul , George , Ringo … and Bert , written by Willy Russell and featuring singer Barbara Dickson , opened in London .
It included , with permission from Northern Songs , eleven Lennon-McCartney compositions and one by Harrison , `` Here Comes the Sun '' .
Displeased with the production 's use of his song , Harrison withdrew his permission to use it .
Later that year , the off-Broadway musical Sgt .
Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band on the Road opened .
All This and World War II ( 1976 ) was an unorthodox nonfiction film that combined newsreel footage with covers of Beatles songs by performers ranging from Elton John and Keith Moon to the London Symphony Orchestra .
The Broadway musical Beatlemania , an unauthorised nostalgia revue , opened in early 1977 and proved popular , spinning off five separate touring productions .
In 1979 , the band sued the producers , settling for several million dollars in damages .
Sgt .
Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band ( 1978 ) , a musical film starring the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton , was a commercial failure and an `` artistic fiasco '' , according to Ingham .
On 24 April 1976 , during a broadcast of Saturday Night Live , producer Lorne Michaels offered the Beatles $ 3,000 to reunite on his show .
Unbeknownst to him , John Lennon and Paul McCartney were watching the live broadcast at John 's apartment at The Dakota in New York at the time , which was within walking distance of the studio where the show was being shot .
The two men entertained the idea of hailing a cab to the studio and surprising Michaels by accepting his offer , but ultimately declined , for as Paul later said `` It would have been work , and we were having a night off , so we elected not to go .
It was a nice idea – we nearly did it .
`` ==== 1980s ==== After the murder of Lennon in December 1980 , Harrison rewrote the lyrics to his song `` All Those Years Ago '' in Lennon 's honour .
With Starr on drums and McCartney and his wife , Linda , contributing backing vocals , the song was released as a single in May 1981 .
McCartney 's own tribute , `` Here Today '' , appeared on his Tug of War album in April 1982 .
In 1987 , Harrison 's Cloud Nine album included `` When We Was Fab '' , a song about the Beatlemania era .
When the Beatles ' studio albums were released on CD by EMI and Apple Corps in 1987 , their catalogue was standardised throughout the world , establishing a canon of the twelve original studio LPs as issued in the UK plus the US LP version of Magical Mystery Tour ( 1967 ) .
All the remaining material from the singles and EPs which had not appeared on the original studio albums was gathered on the two-volume compilation Past Masters ( 1988 ) .
Except for the Red and Blue albums , EMI deleted all its other Beatles compilations – including the Hollywood Bowl record – from its catalogue .
In 1988 , the Beatles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , their first year of eligibility .
Harrison and Starr attended the ceremony with Lennon 's widow , Yoko Ono , and his two sons , Julian and Sean .
McCartney declined to attend , citing unresolved `` business differences '' that would make him `` feel like a complete hypocrite waving and smiling with them at a fake reunion '' .
The following year , EMI/Capitol settled a decade-long lawsuit filed by the band over royalties , clearing the way to commercially package previously unreleased material .
==== 1990s ==== Live at the BBC , the first official release of unissued Beatles performances in seventeen years , appeared in 1994 .
That same year McCartney , Harrison and Starr collaborated on the Anthology project .
Anthology was the culmination of work begun in 1970 , when Apple Corps director Neil Aspinall , their former road manager and personal assistant , had started to gather material for a documentary with the working title The Long and Winding Road .
Documenting their history in the band 's own words , the Anthology project included the release of several unissued Beatles recordings .
McCartney , Harrison and Starr also added new instrumental and vocal parts to two songs recorded as demos by Lennon in the late 1970s .
During 1995–96 , the project yielded a television miniseries , an eight-volume video set , and three two-CD/three-LP box sets featuring artwork by Klaus Voormann .
The two songs based on Lennon demos , `` Free as a Bird '' and `` Real Love '' , were issued as new Beatles singles .
The releases were commercially successful and the television series was viewed by an estimated 400 million people .
In 1999 , to coincide with the re-release of the 1968 film Yellow Submarine , a new soundtrack compilation CD/LP , Yellow Submarine Songtrack , was issued .
==== 2000s ==== The Beatles ' 1 , a compilation album of the band 's British and American number-one hits , was released on 13 November 2000 .
It became the fastest-selling album of all time , with 3.6 million sold in its first week and 13 million within a month .
It topped albums charts in at least 28 countries , including the UK and US .
As of April 2009 , the compilation had sold 31 million copies globally , and was the best-selling album of the decade in the United States .
Harrison died from metastatic lung cancer in November 2001 .
McCartney and Starr were among the musicians who performed at the Concert for George , organised by Eric Clapton and Harrison 's widow , Olivia .
The tribute event took place at the Royal Albert Hall on the first anniversary of Harrison 's death .
In addition to songs he composed for the group and during his solo career , the concert included a celebration of Indian classical music , which had significantly influenced Harrison .
In 2003 , Let It Be ... Naked , a reconceived version of the Let It Be album , with McCartney supervising production , was released .
One of the main differences with the Spector-produced version was the omission of the original string arrangements .
It was a top ten hit in both Britain and America .
The US album configurations from 1964 to 1965 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 – The Capitol Albums , Volume 1 and Volume 2 included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of the music 's original American release .
As a soundtrack for Cirque du Soleil 's Las Vegas Beatles stage revue , Love , George Martin and his son Giles remixed and blended 130 of the band 's recordings to create what Martin called `` a way of re-living the whole Beatles musical lifespan in a very condensed period '' .
The show premiered in June 2006 , and the Love album was released that November when McCartney discussed his hope that `` Carnival of Light '' , a fourteen-minute experimental recording made at Abbey Road in 1967 , would receive an official release .
A rare live performance involving two ex-Beatles took place in April 2009 at a benefit concert organised by McCartney at New York 's Radio City Music Hall , where he was joined by Starr for three songs .
On 9 September 2009 , the Beatles ' entire back catalogue was reissued following an extensive digital remastering process that lasted four years .
Stereo editions of all twelve original UK studio albums , along with Magical Mystery Tour and the Past Masters compilation , were released on compact disc both individually and as a box set .
Comparing the new releases with the 1987 CDs , which had been widely criticised for their lack of clarity and dynamism , Mojo 's Danny Eccleston wrote , `` the remastered vocals are purer , more natural-sounding and give the illusion of sitting slightly higher in the mix .
`` A second collection , The Beatles in Mono , included remastered versions of every Beatles album released in true mono along with the original 1965 stereo mixes of Help !
and Rubber Soul ( which Martin had remixed for the 1987 editions ) .
The Beatles : Rock Band , a music video game in the Rock Band series , was issued on the same day .
In December 2009 , the band 's catalogue was officially released in FLAC and MP3 format in a limited edition of 30,000 USB flash drives .
==== 2010s ==== Owing to a long-running royalty disagreement , the Beatles were among the last major artists to sign deals with online music services .
Residual disagreement emanating from Apple Corps ' dispute with Apple , Inc. , iTunes ' owners , over the use of the name `` Apple '' was also partly responsible for the delay , although in 2008 , McCartney stated that the main obstacle to making the Beatles ' catalogue available online was that EMI `` want [ s ] something we 're not prepared to give them '' .
In 2010 , the official canon of thirteen Beatles studio albums , Past Masters , and the Red and Blue greatest-hits albums were made available on iTunes .
In 2012 , EMI 's recorded music operations were sold to Universal Music Group .
In order for Universal Music to acquire EMI , the European Union , for antitrust reasons , forced EMI to spin off assets including Parlophone .
Universal was allowed to keep the Beatles ' recorded music catalogue , managed by Capitol Records under its Capitol Music Group division .
Also in 2012 , the entire original Beatles album catalogue was reissued on vinyl , available either individually or as a box set .
In 2013 , a second volume of BBC recordings entitled On Air – Live at the BBC Volume 2 was released .
December of that year saw the release of another 59 Beatles recordings on iTunes .
The set , titled The Beatles Bootleg Recordings 1963 , had the opportunity to gain a 70-year copyright extension conditional on the songs being published at least once before the end of 2013 .
Apple Records released the recordings on 17 December to prevent them from going into the public domain and had them taken down from iTunes later that same day .
Fan reactions to the release were mixed , with one blogger saying `` the hardcore Beatles collectors who are trying to obtain everything will already have these .
`` On 26 January 2014 , Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr performed McCartney 's `` Queenie Eye '' in Los Angeles at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards , held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles .
The following day , The Night That Changed America : A Grammy Salute to The Beatles television special was taped in the Los Angeles Convention Center 's West Hall .
It aired on 9 February , the exact date of – and at the same time , and on the same network as – the original broadcast of the Beatles ' first US television appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show , 50 years earlier .
The special included performances of Beatles songs by current artists as well as by McCartney and Starr , archival footage , and Paul and Ringo being interviewed by David Letterman at the Ed Sullivan Theater , site of The Ed Sullivan Show .
In December 2015 , the Beatles released their catalogue for streaming on various streaming music services .
On 18 May 2017 , Sirius XM Radio launched a 24/7 radio channel , The Beatles Channel .
On 26 May 2017 , Sgt .
Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band was reissued with new stereo mixes and unreleased material for the album 's 50th anniversary .
The reissue is available in five different formats – digital format , a single CD , a double CD set , a double vinyl set , and a six-CD deluxe edition box set .
== Musical style and development == In Icons of Rock : An Encyclopedia of the Legends Who Changed Music Forever , Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz describe the Beatles ' musical evolution : In their initial incarnation as cheerful , wisecracking moptops , the Fab Four revolutionised the sound , style , and attitude of popular music and opened rock and roll 's doors to a tidal wave of British rock acts .
Their initial impact would have been enough to establish the Beatles as one of their era 's most influential cultural forces , but they did n't stop there .
Although their initial style was a highly original , irresistibly catchy synthesis of early American rock and roll and R & B , the Beatles spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rock 's stylistic frontiers , consistently staking out new musical territory on each release .
The band 's increasingly sophisticated experimentation encompassed a variety of genres , including folk-rock , country , psychedelia , and baroque pop , without sacrificing the effortless mass appeal of their early work .
In The Beatles as Musicians , Walter Everett describes Lennon and McCartney 's contrasting motivations and approaches to composition : `` McCartney may be said to have constantly developed – as a means to entertain – a focused musical talent with an ear for counterpoint and other aspects of craft in the demonstration of a universally agreed-upon common language that he did much to enrich .
Conversely , Lennon 's mature music is best appreciated as the daring product of a largely unconscious , searching but undisciplined artistic sensibility .
`` Ian MacDonald describes McCartney as `` a natural melodist – a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony '' .
His melody lines are characterised as primarily `` vertical '' , employing wide , consonant intervals which express his `` extrovert energy and optimism '' .
Conversely , Lennon 's `` sedentary , ironic personality '' is reflected in a `` horizontal '' approach featuring minimal , dissonant intervals and repetitive melodies which rely on their harmonic accompaniment for interest : `` Basically a realist , he instinctively kept his melodies close to the rhythms and cadences of speech , colouring his lyrics with bluesy tone and harmony rather than creating tunes that made striking shapes of their own .
`` MacDonald praises Harrison 's lead guitar work for the role his `` characterful lines and textural colourings '' play in supporting Lennon and McCartney 's parts , and describes Starr as `` the father of modern pop/rock drumming '' .
=== Influences === The band 's earliest influences include Elvis Presley , Carl Perkins , Little Richard and Chuck Berry .
During the Beatles ' co-residency with Little Richard at the Star-Club in Hamburg , from April to May 1962 , he advised them on the proper technique for performing his songs .
Of Presley , Lennon said , `` Nothing really affected me until I heard Elvis .
If there had n't been Elvis , there would not have been the Beatles .
`` Other early influences include Buddy Holly , Eddie Cochran , Roy Orbison and the Everly Brothers .
The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success , often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries , including Bob Dylan , the Who , Frank Zappa , the Lovin ' Spoonful , the Byrds and the Beach Boys , whose 1966 album Pet Sounds amazed and inspired McCartney .
Referring to the Beach Boys ' creative leader , Martin later stated : `` No one made a greater impact on the Beatles than Brian [ Wilson ] .
`` Ravi Shankar , with whom Harrison studied for six weeks in India in late 1966 , had a significant effect on his musical development during the band 's later years .
=== Genres === Originating as a skiffle group , the Beatles quickly embraced 1950s rock and roll and helped pioneer the Merseybeat genre , and their repertoire ultimately expanded to include a broad variety of pop music .
Reflecting the range of styles they explored , Lennon said of Beatles for Sale , `` You could call our new one a Beatles country-and-western LP '' , while Gould credits Rubber Soul as `` the instrument by which legions of folk-music enthusiasts were coaxed into the camp of pop '' .
Although the 1965 song `` Yesterday '' was not the first pop record to employ orchestral strings , it marked the group 's first recorded use of classical music elements .
Gould observes : `` The more traditional sound of strings allowed for a fresh appreciation of their talent as composers by listeners who were otherwise allergic to the din of drums and electric guitars .
`` They continued to experiment with string arrangements to various effect ; Sgt .
Pepper 's `` She 's Leaving Home '' , for instance , is `` cast in the mold of a sentimental Victorian ballad '' , Gould writes , `` its words and music filled with the clichés of musical melodrama '' .
The band 's stylistic range expanded in another direction with their 1966 B-side `` Rain '' , described by Martin Strong as `` the first overtly psychedelic Beatles record '' .
Other psychedelic numbers followed , such as `` Tomorrow Never Knows '' ( recorded before `` Rain '' ) , `` Strawberry Fields Forever '' , `` Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds '' and `` I Am the Walrus '' .
The influence of Indian classical music was evident in Harrison 's `` The Inner Light '' , `` Love You To '' and `` Within You Without You '' – Gould describes the latter two as attempts `` to replicate the raga form in miniature '' .
Innovation was the most striking feature of their creative evolution , according to music historian and pianist Michael Campbell : `` 'A Day in the Life ' encapsulates the art and achievement of the Beatles as well as any single track can .
It highlights key features of their music : the sound imagination , the persistence of tuneful melody , and the close coordination between words and music .
It represents a new category of song – more sophisticated than pop ... and uniquely innovative .
There literally had never before been a song – classical or vernacular – that had blended so many disparate elements so imaginatively .
`` Philosophy professor Bruce Ellis Benson agrees : `` the Beatles ... give us a wonderful example of how such far-ranging influences as Celtic music , rhythm and blues , and country and western could be put together in a new way .
`` Author Dominic Pedler describes the way they crossed musical styles : `` Far from moving sequentially from one genre to another ( as is sometimes conveniently suggested ) the group maintained in parallel their mastery of the traditional , catchy chart hit while simultaneously forging rock and dabbling with a wide range of peripheral influences from country to vaudeville .
One of these threads was their take on folk music , which would form such essential groundwork for their later collisions with Indian music and philosophy .
`` As the personal relationships between the band members grew increasingly strained , their individual tastes became more apparent .
The minimalistic cover artwork for the White Album contrasted with the complexity and diversity of its music , which encompassed Lennon 's `` Revolution 9 '' ( whose musique concrète approach was influenced by Yoko Ono ) , Starr 's country song `` Do n't Pass Me By '' , Harrison 's rock ballad `` While My Guitar Gently Weeps '' , and the `` proto-metal roar '' of McCartney 's `` Helter Skelter '' .
=== Contribution of George Martin === George Martin 's close involvement in his role as producer made him one of the leading candidates for the informal title of the `` fifth Beatle '' .
He applied his classical musical training in various ways , and functioned as `` an informal music teacher '' to the progressing songwriters , according to Gould .
Martin suggested to a sceptical McCartney that the arrangement of `` Yesterday '' should feature a string quartet accompaniment , thereby introducing the Beatles to a `` hitherto unsuspected world of classical instrumental colour '' , in MacDonald 's description .
Their creative development was also facilitated by Martin 's willingness to experiment in response to their suggestions , such as adding `` something baroque '' to a particular recording .
In addition to scoring orchestral arrangements for recordings , Martin often performed on them , playing instruments including piano , organ and brass .
Collaborating with Lennon and McCartney required Martin to adapt to their different approaches to songwriting and recording .
MacDonald comments , `` while [ he ] worked more naturally with the conventionally articulate McCartney , the challenge of catering to Lennon 's intuitive approach generally spurred him to his more original arrangements , of which 'Being for the Benefit of Mr .
Kite !
' is an outstanding example .
`` Martin said of the two composers ' distinct songwriting styles and his own stabilising influence : Compared with Paul 's songs , all of which seemed to keep in some sort of touch with reality , John 's had a psychedelic , almost mystical quality ... John 's imagery is one of the best things about his work – 'tangerine trees ' , 'marmalade skies ' , 'cellophane flowers ' ...
I always saw him as an aural Salvador Dalí , rather than some drug-ridden record artist .
On the other hand , I would be stupid to pretend that drugs did n't figure quite heavily in the Beatles ' lives at that time ... they knew that I , in my schoolmasterly role , did n't approve ... Not only was I not into it myself , I could n't see the need for it ; and there 's no doubt that , if I too had been on dope , Pepper would never have been the album it was .
Perhaps it was the combination of dope and no dope that worked , who knows ?
Harrison echoed Martin 's description of his stabilising role : `` I think we just grew through those years together , him as the straight man and us as the loonies ; but he was always there for us to interpret our madness – we used to be slightly avant-garde on certain days of the week , and he would be there as the anchor person , to communicate that through the engineers and on to the tape .
`` === In the studio === Making innovative use of technology while expanding the possibilities of recorded music , the Beatles urged experimentation by Martin and his recording engineers .
Seeking ways to put chance occurrences to creative use , accidental guitar feedback , a resonating glass bottle , a tape loaded the wrong way round so that it played backwards – any of these might be incorporated into their music .
Their desire to create new sounds on every new recording , combined with Martin 's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers Norman Smith , Ken Townsend and Geoff Emerick , all contributed significantly to their records from Rubber Soul and , especially , Revolver onwards .
Along with innovative studio techniques such as sound effects , unconventional microphone placements , tape loops , double tracking and vari-speed recording , the Beatles augmented their songs with instruments that were unconventional in rock music at the time .
These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the sitar in `` Norwegian Wood '' and the swarmandal in `` Strawberry Fields Forever '' .
They also used novel electronic instruments such as the Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the flute voices on the `` Strawberry Fields Forever '' intro , and the clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on `` Baby , You 're a Rich Man '' .
== Legacy == Former Rolling Stone associate editor Robert Greenfield compared the Beatles to Picasso , as `` artists who broke through the constraints of their time period to come up with something that was unique and original ... [ I ] n the form of popular music , no one will ever be more revolutionary , more creative and more distinctive ... '' The British poet Philip Larkin described their work as `` an enchanting and intoxicating hybrid of Negro rock-and-roĺl with their own adolescent romanticism '' , and `` the first advance in popular music since the War '' .
They not only sparked the British Invasion of the US , they became a globally influential phenomenon as well .
From the 1920s , the United States had dominated popular entertainment culture throughout much of the world , via Hollywood movies , jazz , the music of Broadway and Tin Pan Alley and , later , the rock and roll that first emerged in Memphis , Tennessee .
The Beatles are regarded as British cultural icons , with young adults from abroad naming the band among a group of people that they most associated with UK culture .
Their musical innovations and commercial success inspired musicians worldwide .
Many artists have acknowledged the Beatles ' influence and enjoyed chart success with covers of their songs .
On radio , their arrival marked the beginning of a new era ; in 1968 the programme director of New York 's WABC radio station forbade his DJs from playing any `` pre-Beatles '' music , marking the defining line of what would be considered oldies on American radio .
They helped to redefine the album as something more than just a few hits padded out with `` filler '' , and they were primary innovators of the modern music video .
The Shea Stadium show with which they opened their 1965 North American tour attracted an estimated 55,600 people , then the largest audience in concert history ; Spitz describes the event as a `` major breakthrough ... a giant step toward reshaping the concert business '' .
Emulation of their clothing and especially their hairstyles , which became a mark of rebellion , had a global impact on fashion .
According to Gould , the Beatles changed the way people listened to popular music and experienced its role in their lives .
From what began as the Beatlemania fad , the group 's popularity grew into what was seen as an embodiment of sociocultural movements of the decade .
As icons of the 1960s counterculture , Gould continues , they became a catalyst for bohemianism and activism in various social and political arenas , fuelling movements such as women 's liberation , gay liberation and environmentalism .
According to Peter Lavezzoli , after the `` more popular than Jesus '' controversy in 1966 , the Beatles felt considerable pressure to say the right things and `` began a concerted effort to spread a message of wisdom and higher consciousness '' .
== Awards and achievements == In 1965 , Queen Elizabeth II appointed Lennon , McCartney , Harrison and Starr Members of the Order of the British Empire ( MBE ) .
The film Let It Be ( 1970 ) won the 1971 Academy Award for Best Original Song Score .
The recipients of seven Grammy Awards and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards , the Beatles have been awarded six Diamond albums , as well as 24 Multi-Platinum albums , 39 Platinum albums and 45 Gold albums in the United States .
In the UK , the Beatles have four Multi-Platinum albums , four Platinum albums , eight Gold albums and one Silver album .
They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 .
The best-selling band in history , the Beatles have sold more than 800 million physical and digital albums as of 2013 .
They have had more number-one albums on the UK charts , fifteen , and sold more singles in the UK , 21.9 million , than any other act .
In 2004 , Rolling Stone ranked the Beatles as the best artist of all time .
They ranked number one on Billboard magazine 's list of the all-time most successful Hot 100 artists , released in 2008 to celebrate the US singles chart 's 50th anniversary .
As of 2017 , they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Billboard Hot 100 , with twenty .
The Recording Industry Association of America certifies that the Beatles have sold 178 million units in the US , more than any other artist .
They were collectively included in Time magazine 's compilation of the twentieth century 's 100 most influential people .
In 2014 , they received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award .

See also John Lennon discography Paul McCartney discography George Harrison discography Ringo Starr discography Collaborations between ex-Beatles == Song catalogue == Through 1969 , the Beatles ' catalogue was published almost exclusively by Northern Songs Ltd. , a company formed in February 1963 by music publisher Dick James specifically for Lennon and McCartney , though it later acquired songs by other artists .
The company was organised with James and his partner , Emmanuel Silver , owning a controlling interest , variously described as 51 % or 50 % plus one share .
McCartney had 20 % .
Reports again vary concerning Lennon 's portion – 19 or 20 % – and Brian Epstein 's – 9 or 10 % – which he received in lieu of a 25 % band management fee .
In 1965 , the company went public .
Five million shares were created , of which the original principals retained 3.75 million .
James and Silver each received 937,500 shares ( 18.75 % of 5 million ) ; Lennon and McCartney each received 750,000 shares ( 15 % ) ; and Epstein 's management company , NEMS Enterprises , received 375,000 shares ( 7.5 % ) .
Of the 1.25 million shares put up for sale , Harrison and Starr each acquired 40,000 .
At the time of the stock offering , Lennon and McCartney renewed their three-year publishing contracts , binding them to Northern Songs until 1973 .
Harrison created Harrisongs to represent his Beatles compositions , but signed a three-year contract with Northern Songs that gave it the copyright to his work through March 1968 , which included `` Taxman '' and `` Within You Without You '' .
The songs on which Starr received co-writing credit before 1968 , such as `` What Goes On '' and `` Flying '' , were also Northern Songs copyrights .
Harrison did not renew his contract with Northern Songs when it ended , signing instead with Apple Publishing while retaining the copyright to his work from that point on .
Harrisongs thus owns the rights to his later Beatles songs such as `` While My Guitar Gently Weeps '' and `` Something '' .
That year , as well , Starr created Startling Music , which holds the rights to his Beatles compositions , `` Do n't Pass Me By '' and `` Octopus 's Garden '' .
In March 1969 , James arranged to sell his and his partner 's shares of Northern Songs to the British broadcasting company Associated Television ( ATV ) , founded by impresario Lew Grade , without first informing the Beatles .
The band then made a bid to gain controlling interest by attempting to work out a deal with a consortium of London brokerage firms that had accumulated a 14 % holding .
The deal collapsed over the objections of Lennon , who declared , `` I 'm sick of being fucked about by men in suits sitting on their fat arses in the City .
`` By the end of May , ATV had acquired a majority stake in Northern Songs , controlling nearly the entire Lennon–McCartney catalogue , as well as any future material until 1973 .
In frustration , Lennon and McCartney sold their shares to ATV in late October 1969 .
In 1981 , financial losses by ATV 's parent company , ACC , led it to attempt to sell its music division .
According to authors Brian Southall and Rupert Perry , Grade contacted McCartney , offering ATV Music and Northern Songs for $ 30 million .
According to an account McCartney gave in 1995 , he met with Grade and explained he was interested solely in the Northern Songs catalogue , if Grade were ever willing to `` separate off '' that portion of ATV Music .
Soon afterwards , Grade offered to sell him Northern Songs for £20 million , giving the ex-Beatle `` a week or so '' to decide .
By McCartney 's account , he and Ono countered with a £5 million bid that was rejected .
According to reports at the time , Grade refused to separate Northern Songs , and turned down an offer of £21–25 million from McCartney and Ono for ATV Music .
In 1982 , ACC as a whole was sold to Australian business magnate Robert Holmes à Court for £60 million .
Three years later , Michael Jackson purchased ATV for a reported $ 47.5 million .
The acquisition gave him control over the publishing rights to more than 200 Beatles songs , as well as 40,000 other copyrights .
In 1995 , in a deal that earned him a reported $ 110 million , Jackson merged his music publishing business with Sony , creating a new company , Sony/ATV Music Publishing , in which he held a 50 % stake .
The merger made the new company , then valued at over half a billion dollars , the third largest music publisher in the world .
In 2016 , Sony acquired Jackson 's share of Sony/ATV from the Jackson estate for $ 750 million .
Despite the lack of publishing rights to most of their songs , Lennon 's estate and McCartney continue to receive their respective shares of the writers ' royalties , which together are 33⅓ % of total commercial proceeds in the US and which vary elsewhere around the world between 50 and 55 % .
Two of Lennon and McCartney 's earliest songs – `` Love Me Do '' and `` P.S .
I Love You '' – were published by an EMI subsidiary , Ardmore & Beechwood , before they signed with James .
McCartney acquired their publishing rights from Ardmore in the mid-1980s , and they are the only two Beatles songs owned by McCartney 's company MPL Communications .
On 18 January 2017 , McCartney filed a suit in United States district court against Sony/ATV Music Publishing seeking to reclaim ownership of his share of the Lennon–McCartney song catalogue beginning in 2018 .
Under US copyright law , for works published before 1978 the author can reclaim copyrights assigned to a publisher after 56 years .

A trumpet is a blown musical instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles .
The trumpet group contains the instruments with the highest register in the brass family .
Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting , with examples dating back to at least 1500 BC ; they began to be used as musical instruments only in the late 14th or early 15th century .
Trumpets are used in art music styles , for instance in orchestras , concert bands , and jazz ensembles , as well as in popular music .
They are played by blowing air through almost-closed lips ( called the player 's embouchure ) , producing a `` buzzing '' sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument .
Since the late 15th century they have primarily been constructed of brass tubing , usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape .
There are many distinct types of trumpet , with the most common being pitched in B♭ ( a transposing instrument ) , having a tubing length of about 1.48 m ( 4 ft 10 in ) .
Early trumpets did not provide means to change the length of tubing , whereas modern instruments generally have three ( or sometimes four ) valves in order to change their pitch .
Most trumpets have valves of the piston type , while some have the rotary type .
The use of rotary-valved trumpets is more common in orchestral settings , although this practice varies by country .
Each valve , when engaged , increases the length of tubing , lowering the pitch of the instrument .
A musician who plays the trumpet is called a trumpet player or trumpeter .
== Etymology == The English word `` trumpet '' was first used in the late 14th century .
The word came from Old French `` trompette '' , which is a `` diminutive of trompe '' .
The word `` trump '' , meaning `` trumpet , '' was first used in English in 1300 .
The word comes `` from Old French trompe `` long , tube-like musical wind instrument '' ( 12c .
) , cognate with Provençal tromba , Italian tromba , all probably from a Germanic source ( compare Old High German trumpa , Old Norse trumba `` trumpet '' ) , of imitative origin .
`` == History == The earliest trumpets date back to 1500 BC and earlier .
The bronze and silver trumpets from Tutankhamun 's grave in Egypt , bronze lurs from Scandinavia , and metal trumpets from China date back to this period .
Trumpets from the Oxus civilization ( 3rd millennium BC ) of Central Asia have decorated swellings in the middle , yet are made out of one sheet of metal , which is considered a technical wonder .
The Shofar , made from a ram horn and the Hatzotzeroth , made of metal , are both mentioned in the Bible .
They were played in Solomon 's Temple around 3000 years ago .
They were said to be used to blow down the walls of Jericho .
They are still used on certain religious days .
The Salpinx was a straight trumpet 62 inches ( 1,600 mm ) long , made of bone or bronze .
Salpinx contests were a part of the original Olympic Games .
The Moche people of ancient Peru depicted trumpets in their art going back to AD 300 .
The earliest trumpets were signaling instruments used for military or religious purposes , rather than music in the modern sense ; and the modern bugle continues this signaling tradition .
Improvements to instrument design and metal making in the late Middle Ages and Renaissance led to an increased usefulness of the trumpet as a musical instrument .
The natural trumpets of this era consisted of a single coiled tube without valves and therefore could only produce the notes of a single overtone series .
Changing keys required the player to change crooks of the instrument .
The development of the upper , `` clarino '' register by specialist trumpeters—notably Cesare Bendinelli—would lend itself well to the Baroque era , also known as the `` Golden Age of the natural trumpet .
`` During this period , a vast body of music was written for virtuoso trumpeters .
The art was revived in the mid-20th century and natural trumpet playing is again a thriving art around the world .
Many modern players in Germany and the UK who perform Baroque music use a version of the natural trumpet fitted with three or four vent holes to aid in correcting out-of-tune notes in the harmonic series .
The melody-dominated homophony of the classical and romantic periods relegated the trumpet to a secondary role by most major composers owing to the limitations of the natural trumpet .
Berlioz wrote in 1844 : Notwithstanding the real loftiness and distinguished nature of its quality of tone , there are few instruments that have been more degraded ( than the trumpet ) .
Down to Beethoven and Weber , every composer – not excepting Mozart – persisted in confining it to the unworthy function of filling up , or in causing it to sound two or three commonplace rhythmical formulae .
The attempt to give the trumpet more chromatic freedom in its range saw the development of the keyed trumpet , but this was a largely unsuccessful venture due to the poor quality of its sound .
Although the impetus for a tubular valve began as early as 1793 , it was not until 1818 that Friedrich Bluhmel and Heinrich Stölzel made a joint patent application for the box valve as manufactured by W. Schuster .
The symphonies of Mozart , Beethoven , and as late as Brahms , were still played on natural trumpets .
Crooks and shanks ( removable tubing of various lengths ) as opposed to keys or valves were standard , notably in France , into the first part of the 20th century .
As a consequence of this late development of the instrument 's chromatic ability , the repertoire for the instrument is relatively small compared to other instruments .
The 20th century saw an explosion in the amount and variety of music written for the trumpet .
== Construction == The trumpet is constructed of brass tubing bent twice into a rounded oblong shape .
As with all brass instruments , sound is produced by blowing air through closed lips , producing a `` buzzing '' sound into the mouthpiece and starting a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the trumpet .
The player can select the pitch from a range of overtones or harmonics by changing the lip aperture and tension ( known as the embouchure ) .
The mouthpiece has a circular rim , which provides a comfortable environment for the lips ' vibration .
Directly behind the rim is the cup , which channels the air into a much smaller opening ( the back bore or shank ) that tapers out slightly to match the diameter of the trumpet 's lead pipe .
The dimensions of these parts of the mouthpiece affect the timbre or quality of sound , the ease of playability , and player comfort .
Generally , the wider and deeper the cup , the darker the sound and timbre .
Modern trumpets have three ( or infrequently four ) piston valves , each of which increases the length of tubing when engaged , thereby lowering the pitch .
The first valve lowers the instrument 's pitch by a whole step ( 2 semitones ) , the second valve by a half step ( 1 semitone ) , and the third valve by one-and-a-half steps ( 3 semitones ) .
When a fourth valve is present , as with some piccolo trumpets , it usually lowers the pitch a perfect fourth ( 5 semitones ) .
Used singly and in combination these valves make the instrument fully chromatic , i.e. , able to play all twelve pitches of classical music .
For more information about the different types of valves , see Brass instrument valves .
The pitch of the trumpet can be raised or lowered by the use of the tuning slide .
Pulling the slide out lowers the pitch ; pushing the slide in raises it .
To overcome the problems of intonation and reduce the use of the slide , Renold Schilke designed the tuning-bell trumpet .
Removing the usual brace between the bell and a valve body allows the use of a sliding bell ; the player may then tune the horn with the bell while leaving the slide pushed in , or nearly so , thereby improving intonation and overall response .
A trumpet becomes a closed tube when the player presses it to the lips ; therefore , the instrument only naturally produces every other overtone of the harmonic series .
The shape of the bell makes the missing overtones audible .
Most notes in the series are slightly out of tune and modern trumpets have slide mechanisms for the first and third valves with which the player can compensate by throwing ( extending ) or retracting one or both slides , using the left thumb and ring finger for the first and third valve slides respectively .
== Types == The most common type is the B♭ trumpet , but A , C , D , E♭ , E , low F , and G trumpets are also available .
The C trumpet is most common in American orchestral playing , where it is used alongside the B♭ trumpet .
Its slightly smaller size gives it a brighter sound , clearer projection , and crisper articulation .
Orchestral trumpet players are adept at transposing music at sight , frequently playing music written for the A , B♭ , D , E♭ , E , or F trumpet on the C trumpet or B♭ trumpet .
The smallest trumpets are referred to as piccolo trumpets .
The most common of these are built to play in both B♭ and A , with separate leadpipes for each key .
The tubing in the B♭ piccolo trumpet is one-half the length of that in a standard B♭ trumpet .
Piccolo trumpets in G , F and C are also manufactured , but are less common .
Many players use a smaller mouthpiece on the piccolo trumpet , which requires a different sound production technique from the B♭ trumpet and can limit endurance .
Almost all piccolo trumpets have four valves instead of the usual three — the fourth valve lowers the pitch , usually by a fourth , to assist in the playing of lower notes and to create alternate fingerings that facilitate certain trills .
Maurice André , Håkan Hardenberger , David Mason , and Wynton Marsalis are some well-known trumpet players known for their additional virtuosity on the piccolo trumpet .
Trumpets pitched in the key of low G are also called sopranos , or soprano bugles , after their adaptation from military bugles .
Traditionally used in drum and bugle corps , sopranos have featured both rotary valves and piston valves .
The bass trumpet is usually played by a trombone player , being at the same pitch .
Bass trumpet is played with a shallower trombone mouthpiece , and music for it is written in treble clef .
The most common keys for bass trumpets are C and B♭ .
Both C and B♭ bass trumpets are transposing instruments sounding an octave ( C ) or a major ninth ( B♭ ) lower than written .
The modern slide trumpet is a B♭ trumpet that has a slide instead of valves .
It is similar to a soprano trombone .
The first slide trumpets emerged during the Renaissance , predating the modern trombone , and are the first attempts to increase chromaticism on the instrument .
Slide trumpets were the first trumpets allowed in the Christian church .
The historical slide trumpet was probably first developed in the late 14th century for use in alta capella wind bands .
Deriving from early straight trumpets , the Renaissance slide trumpet was essentially a natural trumpet with a sliding leadpipe .
This single slide was rather awkward , as the entire corpus of the instrument moved , and the range of the slide was probably no more than a major third .
Originals were probably pitched in D , to fit with shawms in D and G , probably at a typical pitch standard near A=466 Hz .
As no known instruments from this period survive , the details—and even the existence—of a Renaissance slide trumpet is a matter of conjecture and debate among scholars .
Some slide trumpet designs saw use in England in the 18th century .
The pocket trumpet is a compact B♭ trumpet .
The bell is usually smaller than a standard trumpet and the tubing is more tightly wound to reduce the instrument size without reducing the total tube length .
Its design is not standardized , and the quality of various models varies greatly .
It can have a tone quality and projection unique in the trumpet world : a warm sound and a voice-like articulation .
Since many pocket trumpet models suffer from poor design as well as cheap and imprecise manufacturing , the intonation , tone color and dynamic range of such instruments are severely hindered .
Professional-standard instruments are , however , available .
While they are not a substitute for the full-sized instrument , they can be useful in certain contexts .
The jazz musician Don Cherry was renowned for his playing of the pocket instrument .
The herald trumpet has an elongated bell extending far in front of the player , allowing a standard length of tubing from which a flag may be hung ; the instrument is mostly used for ceremonial events such as parades and fanfares .
The 20th century saw some experimentation with the layout and construction of the trumpet , notably with the introduction of balanced action instruments ( with forward set valves ) by Selmer , Olds and King in the 1930s and 40s , and heavy reinforcements and geometry changes by Monette beginning in 1983 .
There are also rotary-valve , or German , trumpets ( which are commonly used in professional European orchestras ) as well as alto and Baroque trumpets .
The trumpet is often confused with its close relative the cornet , which has a more conical tubing shape compared to the trumpet 's more cylindrical tube .
This , along with additional bends in the cornet 's tubing , gives the cornet a slightly mellower tone , but the instruments are otherwise nearly identical .
They have the same length of tubing and , therefore , the same pitch , so music written for cornet and trumpet is interchangeable .
Another relative , the flugelhorn , has tubing that is even more conical than that of the cornet , and an even richer tone .
It is sometimes augmented with a fourth valve to improve the intonation of some lower notes .
== Playing == === Fingering === On any modern trumpet , cornet , or flugelhorn , pressing the valves indicated by the numbers below produces the written notes shown .
`` Open '' means all valves up , `` 1 '' means first valve , `` 1-2 '' means first and second valve simultaneously , and so on .
The sounding pitch depends on the transposition of the instrument .
Engaging the fourth valve , if present , usually drops any of these pitches by a perfect fourth as well .
Within each overtone series , the different pitches are attained by changing the embouchure .
Standard fingerings above high C are the same as for the notes an octave below ( C♯ is 1-2 , D is 1 , etc .
) Each overtone series on the trumpet begins with the first overtone—the fundamental of each overtone series can not be produced except as a pedal tone .
Notes in parentheses are the sixth overtone , representing a pitch with a frequency of seven times that of the fundamental ; while this pitch is close to the note shown , it is slightly flat relative to equal temperament , and use of those fingerings is generally avoided .
The fingering schema arises from the length of each valve 's tubing ( a longer tube produces a lower pitch ) .
Valve `` 1 '' increases the tubing length enough to lower the pitch by one whole step , valve `` 2 '' by one half step , and valve `` 3 '' by one and a half steps .
This scheme and the nature of the overtone series create the possibility of alternate fingerings for certain notes .
For example , third-space `` C '' can be produced with no valves engaged ( standard fingering ) or with valves 2-3 .
Also , any note produced with 1-2 as its standard fingering can also be produced with valve 3 - each drops the pitch by  1 1⁄2 steps .
Alternate fingerings may be used to improve facility in certain passages , or to aid in intonation .
Extending the third valve slide when using the fingerings 1-3 or 1-2-3 further lowers the pitch slightly to improve intonation .
=== Mute === Various types of mutes can be used to alter the sound of the instrument when placed in or over the bell .
While most types of mutes do decrease the volume the instrument produces , as the name implies , the sound modification is typically the primary reason for their use .
== Range == The standard trumpet range extends from the written F♯ immediately below Middle C up to about three octaves higher .
Traditional trumpet repertoire rarely calls for notes beyond this range , and the fingering tables of most method books peak at the high C , two octaves above middle C. Several trumpeters have achieved fame for their proficiency in the extreme high register , among them Maynard Ferguson , Cat Anderson , Dizzy Gillespie , Doc Severinsen , and more recently Wayne Bergeron , Thomas Gansch , James Morrison , Jon Faddis and Arturo Sandoval .
It is also possible to produce pedal tones below the low F♯ , which is a device commonly employed in contemporary repertoire for the instrument .
=== Extended technique === Contemporary music for the trumpet makes wide uses of extended trumpet techniques .
Flutter tonguing : The trumpeter rolls the tip of the tongue to produce a 'growling like ' tone .
It is achieved as if one were rolling an R in the Spanish language .
This technique is widely employed by composers like Berio and Stockhausen .
Growling : Simultaneously playing tone while using the back of the tongue to vibrate the uvula creating a distinct sound .
Most trumpet players will use a plunger with this technique to achieve a particular sound heard in a lot of Chicago Jazz of the 1950s .
Double tonguing : The player articulates using the syllables ta-ka ta-ka ta-ka Triple tonguing : The same as double tonguing , but with the syllables ta-ta-ka ta-ta-ka ta-ta-ka or ta-ka-ta ta-ka-ta .
Doodle tongue : The trumpeter tongues as if saying the word doodle .
This is a very faint tonguing similar in sound to a valve tremolo .
Glissando : Trumpeters can slide between notes by depressing the valves halfway and changing the lip tension .
Modern repertoire makes extensive use of this technique .
Vibrato : It is often regulated in contemporary repertoire through specific notation .
Composers can call for everything from fast , slow or no vibrato to actual rhythmic patterns played with vibrato .
Pedal tone : Composers have written for two-and-a-half octaves below the low F♯ , which is at the bottom of the standard range .
Extreme low pedals are produced by slipping the lower lip out of the mouthpiece .
Claude Gordon assigned pedals as part of his trumpet practice routines , that were a systematic expansion on his lessons with Herbert L. Clarke .
The technique was pioneered by Bohumir Kryl .
Microtones : Composers such as Scelsi and Stockhausen have made wide use of the trumpet 's ability to play microtonally .
Some instruments feature a fourth valve that provides a quarter-tone step between each note .
The jazz musician Ibrahim Maalouf uses such a trumpet , invented by his father to make it possible to play Arab maqams .
Valve tremolo : Many notes on the trumpet can be played in several different valve combinations .
By alternating between valve combinations on the same note , a tremolo effect can be created .
Berio makes extended use of this technique in his Sequenza X .
Noises : By hissing , clicking , or breathing through the instrument , the trumpet can be made to resonate in ways that do not sound at all like a trumpet .
Noises may require amplification .
Preparation : Composers have called for trumpeters to play under water , or with certain slides removed .
It is increasingly common for composers to specify all sorts of preparations for trumpet .
Extreme preparations involve alternate constructions , such as double bells and extra valves .
Split tone : Trumpeters can produce more than one tone simultaneously by vibrating the two lips at different speeds .
The interval produced is usually an octave or a fifth .
Lip-Trill or Shake : Also known as `` lip-slurs '' .
By rapidly varying air speed , but not changing the depressed valves , the pitch varies quickly between adjacent harmonic partials .
Shakes and lip-trills can vary in speed and the distance between the partials can be as large or small as the musicians ' desires .
Traditionally , however , lip-trills and shakes are usually the next partial up from the written note .
Multi-phonics : Playing a note and `` humming '' a different note simultaneously .
For example , sustaining a middle C and humming a major 3rd `` E '' at the same time .
Circular breathing : A technique wind players use to produce uninterrupted tone , without pauses for breaths .
The player puffs up the cheeks , storing air , then breathes in rapidly through the nose while using the cheeks to continue pushing air outwards .
=== Instruction and method books === One trumpet method publication of long-standing popularity is Jean-Baptiste Arban 's Complete Conservatory Method for Trumpet ( Cornet ) .
Other well-known method books include Technical Studies by Herbert L. Clarke , Grand Method by Louis Saint-Jacome , Daily Drills and Technical Studies by Max Schlossberg , and methods by Ernest S. Williams , Claude Gordon , Charles Colin , James Stamp , and Louis Davidson .
Vassily Brandt 's Orchestral Etudes and Last Etudes is used in many college and conservatory trumpet studios , containing drills on permutations of standard orchestral trumpet repertoire , transpositions , and other advanced material .
A common method book for beginners is the Walter Beeler 's Method for the Cornet , and there have been several instruction books written by virtuoso Allen Vizzutti .
== Players == In early jazz , Louis Armstrong was well known for his virtuosity and his improvisations on the Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings .
Miles Davis is widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century—his style was distinctive and widely imitated .
Davis ' phrasing and sense of space in his solos have been models for generations of jazz musicians .
Dizzy Gillespie was a gifted improviser with an extremely high ( but musical ) range , building on the style of Roy Eldridge but adding new layers of harmonic complexity .
Gillespie had an enormous impact on virtually every subsequent trumpeter , both by the example of his playing and as a mentor to younger musicians .
Maynard Ferguson came to prominence playing in Stan Kenton 's orchestra , before forming his own band in 1957 .
He was noted for being able to play accurately in a remarkably high register .
Some other notable jazz/commercial trumpet players include James Morrison , Roy Eldridge , Nat Adderley , Bud Brisbois , Randy Brecker , Chet Baker , Clifford Brown , Chris Botti , Allan Botschinsky , Donald Byrd , Bill Chase , Doc Cheatham , Don Cherry , Kenny Dorham , Dave Douglas , Don Ellis , Ziggy Elman , Jon Faddis , Thomas Gansch , Tim Hagans , Roy Hargrove , Tom Harrell , Erskine Hawkins , Al Hirt , Freddie Hubbard , Roger Ingram , Harry James , Ibrahim Maalouf , Chuck Mangione , Wynton Marsalis , Billy May , Blue Mitchell , Lee Morgan , Fats Navarro , Nicholas Payton , Louis Prima , Uan Rasey , Claudio Roditi , Wallace Roney , Arturo Sandoval , Manfred Schoof , Bobby Shew , Dale Turner , Doc Severinsen , Woody Shaw , Tomasz Stańko , Markus Stockhausen , Clark Terry , Wayne Bergeron , Allen Vizzutti , Cootie Williams , and Snooky Young .
Notable classical trumpeters include Maurice André , Armando Ghitalla , Alison Balsom , Hakan Hardenberger , Tine Thing Helseth , Adolph `` Bud '' Herseth , Malcolm McNab , Rafael Méndez , Maurice Murphy , Sergei Nakariakov , Uan Rasey , Charles Schlueter , Philip Smith , William Vacchiano , Allen Vizzutti , and Roger Voisin .
Notable natural trumpet players include Valentine Snow , for whom Handel wrote several pieces , and Gottfried Reiche , who was Bach 's chief trumpeter .
== Musical pieces == === Solos === The repertoire for the natural trumpet and cornetto is extensive .
This music is commonly played on modern piccolo trumpets , although there are many highly proficient performers of the original instruments .
This vast body of repertoire includes the music of Gabrieli , Monteverdi , Bach , Vivaldi , and countless other composers .
Because the overtone series does not allow stepwise movement until the upper register , the tessitura for this repertoire is very high .
Anton Weidinger developed in the 1790s the first successful keyed trumpet , capable of playing all the chromatic notes in its range .
Joseph Haydn 's Trumpet Concerto was written for him in 1796 and startled contemporary audiences by its novelty , a fact shown off by some stepwise melodies played low in the instrument 's range .

Bruce Duncan `` Utah '' Phillips ( May 15 , 1935 – May 23 , 2008 ) was an American labor organizer , folk singer , storyteller , poet and the `` Golden Voice of the Great Southwest '' .
He described the struggles of labor unions and the power of direct action , self-identifying as an anarchist .
He often promoted the Industrial Workers of the World in his music , actions , and words .
== Biography == === Early years === Phillips was born in Cleveland , Ohio , to Edwin Deroger Phillips and Frances Kathleen Coates .
His father , Edwin Phillips , was a labor organizer , and his parents ' activism influenced much of his life 's work .
Phillips was a card-carrying member of the Industrial Workers of the World ( Wobblies ) headquartered in Chicago , Illinois .
His parents divorced and his mother remarried .
Phillips was adopted by his stepfather , Syd Cohen , at the age of five .
Cohen managed the Hippodrome Theater in Cleveland , one of the last vaudeville houses in the city .
Cohen moved the family to Salt Lake City , Utah , where he managed the Lyric Theater , another vaudeville house .
Phillips attributes his early exposure to vaudeville through his stepfather as being an important influence on his later career .
Phillips attended East High School in Salt Lake City , where he was involved in the arts and plays .
He served in the United States Army for three years in the 1950s .
Witnessing the devastation of post-war Korea greatly influenced his social and political thinking .
After discharge from the army , Phillips rode the railroads , and wrote songs .
=== Career === While riding the rails and tramping around the west , Phillips returned to Salt Lake City , where he met Ammon Hennacy from the Catholic Worker Movement .
He gave credit to Hennacy for saving him from a life of drifting to one dedicated to using his gifts and talents toward activism and public service .
Phillips assisted him in establishing a mission house of hospitality named after the activist Joe Hill .
Phillips worked at the Joe Hill House for the next eight years , then ran for the U.S. Senate as a candidate of Utah 's Peace and Freedom Party in 1968 .
He received 2,019 votes ( 0.5 % ) in an election won by Republican Wallace F. Bennett .
He also ran for president of the United States in 1976 for the Do-Nothing Party .
He adopted the name U. Utah Phillips in keeping with the hobo tradition of adopting a moniker that included an initial and the state of origin , and in emulation of country vocalist T. Texas Tyler .
Phillips met folk singer Rosalie Sorrels in the early 1950s , and remained a close friend of hers .
Sorrels started playing the songs that Phillips wrote , and through her his music began to spread .
After leaving Utah in the late 1960s , he went to Saratoga Springs , New York , where he was befriended by the folk community at the Caffè Lena coffee house .
He became a staple performer there for a decade , and would return throughout his career .
Phillips was a member of the Industrial Workers of the World ( IWW or Wobblies ) .
His views of unions and politics were shaped by his parents , especially his Mom who was a labor organizer for the CIO .
But Phillips was more of a Christian anarchist and a pacifist , so found the modern-day Wobblies to be the perfect fit for him , an iconoclast and artist .
In recent years , perhaps no single person did more to spread the Wobbly gospel than Phillips , whose countless concerts were , in effect , organizing meetings for the cause of labor , unions , anarchism , pacifism , and the Wobblies .
He was a tremendous interpreter of classic Wobbly tunes including `` Hallelujah , I 'm a Bum , '' `` The Preacher and the Slave , '' and `` Bread and Roses .
`` An avid trainhopper , Phillips recorded several albums of music related to the railroads , especially the era of steam locomotives .
His 1973 album , Good Though ! , is an example , and contains such songs as `` Daddy , What 's a Train ?
`` and `` Queen of the Rails '' as well as what may be his most famous composition , `` Moose Turd Pie '' wherein he tells a tall tale of his work as a gandy dancer repairing track in the Southwestern United States desert .
In 1991 Phillips recorded , in one take , an album of song , poetry and short stories entitled I 've Got To Know , inspired by his anger at the first Gulf War .
The album includes `` Enola Gay , '' his first composition written about the United States ' atomic attack on Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
Phillips was a mentor to Kate Wolf .
He recorded songs and stories with Rosalie Sorrels on a CD called The Long Memory ( 1996 ) , originally a college project `` Worker 's Doxology '' for 1992 'cold-drill Magazine ' Boise State University .
His protégée , Ani DiFranco , recorded two CDs , The Past Did n't Go Anywhere ( 1996 ) and Fellow Workers ( 1999 ) , with him .
He was nominated for a Grammy Award for his work with DiFranco .
His `` Green Rolling Hills '' was made into a country hit by Emmylou Harris , and `` The Goodnight-Loving Trail '' became a classic as well , being recorded by Ian Tyson , Tom Waits , and others .
=== Later years === Though known primarily for his work as a concert performer and labor organizer , Phillips also worked as an archivist , dishwasher , and warehouse-man .
Phillips was a member of various socio-political organizations and groups throughout his life .
A strong supporter of labor struggles , he was a member of the Industrial Workers of the World ( IWW ) , the International Union of Mine , Mill , and Smelter Workers ( Mine Mill ) , and the Travelling Musician 's Union AFM Local 1000 .
In solidarity with the poor , he was also an honorary member of Dignity Village , a homeless community .
A pacifist , he was a member of Veterans for Peace and the Peace Center of Nevada County .
In his personal life , Phillips enjoyed varied hobbies and interests .
These included Egyptology ; amateur chemistry ; linguistics ; history ( Asian , African , Mormon and world ) ; futhark ; debate ; and poetry .
He also enjoyed culinary hobbies , such as pickling , cooking and gardening .
He married Joanna Robinson on July 31 , 1989 , in Nevada City .
Phillips became an elder statesman for the folk music community , and a keeper of stories and songs that might otherwise have passed into obscurity .
He was also a member of the great Traveling Nation , the community of hobos and railroad bums that populates the Midwest United States along the rail lines , and was an important keeper of their history and culture .
He also became an honorary member of numerous folk societies in the U.S.A. and Canada .
When Kate Wolf grew ill and was forced to cancel concerts , she asked Phillips to fill in .
Suffering from an ailment which makes it more difficult to play guitar , Phillips hesitated , citing his declining guitar ability .
`` Nobody ever came just to hear you play , '' she said .
Phillips told this story as a way of explaining how his style over the years became increasingly based on storytelling instead of just songs .
He was a gifted storyteller and monologist , and his concerts generally had an even mix of spoken word and sung content .
He attributed much of his success to his personality .
`` It is better to be likeable than talented , '' he often said , self-deprecatingly .
Until it lost its funding , Phillips hosted his own weekly radio show , Loafer 's Glory : The Hobo Jungle of the Mind , originating on KVMR and nationally syndicated .
Phillips lived in Nevada City , California , for 21 years where he worked on the start-up of the Hospitality House , a homeless shelter , and the Peace and Justice Center .

Woodrow Wilson Guthrie ( ; July 14 , 1912 – October 3 , 1967 ) was an American singer-songwriter who is regarded as one of the most significant figures in American folk music ; his songs , including social justice songs , such as `` This Land Is Your Land '' , have inspired several generations both politically and musically .
He wrote hundreds of political , folk , and children 's songs , along with ballads and improvised works , sometimes with a Communist leaning .
His album of songs about the Dust Bowl period , Dust Bowl Ballads , is included on Mojo magazine 's 100 Records That Changed The World .
Many of his recorded songs are archived in the Library of Congress .
Songwriters such as Bob Dylan , Phil Ochs , Johnny Cash , Bruce Springsteen , Robert Hunter , Harry Chapin , John Mellencamp , Pete Seeger , Andy Irvine , Joe Strummer , Billy Bragg , Jerry Garcia , Jay Farrar , Bob Weir , Jeff Tweedy , Bob Childers , Sammy Walker and Tom Paxton have acknowledged Guthrie as a major influence .
He frequently performed with the slogan This machine kills fascists displayed on his guitar .
Guthrie was brought up by middle-class parents in Okemah , Oklahoma until he was 14 , when his mother was hospitalised as a consequence of Huntington 's disease , a hereditary neurological disorder , and his father had to move to Pampa , Texas to repay debts from unsuccessful real estate deals .
During his early teens Guthrie learned folk and blues songs from his parents ' friends .
He married at 19 , but with the advent of the dust storms that marked the Dust Bowl period , he left his wife and three children to join the thousands of Okies who were migrating to California looking for work .
He worked at Los Angeles radio station KFVD , achieving some fame from playing hill-billy music ; made friends with Will Geer and John Steinbeck ; and wrote a column for the Communist newspaper People 's World from May 1939 to January 1940 .
Throughout his life Guthrie was associated with United States Communist groups , although he was seemingly not a member of any .
With the outbreak of World War II and the non-aggression pact the Soviet Union had signed with Germany in 1939 , the owners of KFVD radio were not comfortable with Guthrie 's Communist sympathies ; he left the station , ending up in New York where he wrote and recorded his 1940 album Dust Bowl Ballads , based on his Dust Bowl experiences , and which earned him the nickname the `` Dust Bowl Troubadour '' .
In February 1940 he wrote his most famous song , `` This Land Is Your Land '' , as a response to what he felt was an overplaying of Irving Berlin 's `` God Bless America '' on the radio .
Guthrie was married three times and fathered eight children , including American folk musician Arlo Guthrie .
Guthrie died from complications of Huntington 's disease .
During his later years , in spite of his illness , Guthrie served as a figurehead in the folk movement , providing inspiration to a generation of new folk musicians , including mentoring Ramblin ' Jack Elliott and Bob Dylan .
== Biography == === Early life : 1912–30 === Guthrie was born 14 July 1912 in Okemah , a small town in Okfuskee County , Oklahoma , the son of Nora Belle ( née Sherman ) and Charles Edward Guthrie .
His parents named him after Woodrow Wilson , then Governor of New Jersey and the Democratic candidate soon to be elected President of the United States .
Charles Guthrie was an industrious businessman , owning at one time up to 30 plots of land in Okfuskee County .
He was actively involved in Oklahoma politics and was a conservative Democratic candidate for office in the county .
Charles Guthrie was involved in the 1911 lynching of Laura and L. D. Nelson .
Woody Guthrie wrote three songs about the event and said that his father , Charles , was later a member of the revived Ku Klux Klan .
There were three significant fires during Guthrie 's early life , including one that caused the loss of his family 's home in Okemah .
His sister Clara died after setting her clothes on fire during an argument with her mother when Guthrie was seven , and Guthrie 's father was severely burned in a fire at home .
Guthrie 's mother , Nora , was afflicted with Huntington 's disease , although the family did not know this at the time .
It leads to dementia as well as muscular degeneration .
She was committed to the Oklahoma Hospital for the Insane .
When Nora Guthrie was institutionalized , Woody Guthrie was 14 .
His father Charley was living and working in Pampa , Texas , to repay his debts from unsuccessful real estate deals .
Woody and his siblings were on their own in Oklahoma ; they relied on their eldest brother Roy for support .
The 14-year-old Woody Guthrie worked odd jobs around Okemah , begging meals and sometimes sleeping at the homes of family friends .
Guthrie had a natural affinity for music , learning old ballads and traditional English and Scottish songs from the parents of friends .
According to one story , Guthrie befriended an African-American blues harmonica player named `` George '' , whom he would watch play at the man 's shoe shine booth .
Before long , Guthrie bought his own harmonica and began playing along with him .
In another interview 14 years later , Guthrie claimed he learned how to play harmonica from a boyhood friend , John Woods , and that his earlier story about the shoe-shining player was false .
He used to busk for money and food .
Although he did not excel as a student ( he dropped out of high school in his fourth year and did not graduate ) , his teachers described him as bright .
He was an avid reader on a wide range of topics .
Friends recall his reading constantly .
In 1929 , Guthrie 's father sent for his son to come to Texas , but little changed for the aspiring musician .
Guthrie , then 18 , was reluctant to attend high school classes in Pampa and spent much time learning songs by busking on the streets and reading in the library at Pampa 's city hall .
He was able to gain experience by regularly playing at dances with his father 's half-brother Jeff Guthrie , a fiddle player .
At age 19 , Guthrie met and married his first wife , Mary Jennings , with whom he had three children , Gwendolyn , Sue , and Bill .
His mother died in 1930 while in the Oklahoma Hospital for the Insane .
=== 1930s : California === During the Dust Bowl period , Guthrie joined the thousands of Okies who were migrating to California looking for work , leaving his wife and children in Texas .
Many of his songs are concerned with the conditions faced by these working-class people .
During the late part of that decade , he achieved fame with radio partner Maxine `` Lefty Lou '' Crissman as a broadcast performer of commercial `` hillbilly '' music and traditional folk music .
Guthrie was making enough money to send for his family , who were still living in Texas .
While appearing on the commercial radio station KFVD , owned by a populist-minded New Deal Democrat , Frank W. Burke , Guthrie began to write and perform some of the protest songs that would eventually appear on Dust Bowl Ballads .
While at KFVD , Guthrie met newscaster Ed Robbin .
Robbin was impressed with a song Guthrie wrote about political activist Thomas Mooney , believed by many to be wrongly convicted in a case that was a cause célèbre of the time .
Robbin , who became Guthrie 's political mentor , introduced Guthrie to socialists and Communists in Southern California , including Will Geer ( who , in turn , introduced Guthrie to John Steinbeck ) .
Robbin remained Guthrie 's lifelong friend , and helped Guthrie book benefit performances in the Communist circles in Southern California .
Notwithstanding Guthrie 's later claim that `` the best thing that I did in 1936 was to sign up with the Communist Party , '' he was never a member of the party .
He was noted as a fellow traveler—an outsider who agreed with the platform of the party while not subject to party discipline .
Guthrie wrote a column for the Communist newspaper , People 's World .
The column , titled `` Woody Sez '' , appeared a total of 174 times from May 1939 to January 1940 .
`` Woody Sez '' was not explicitly political , but was about current events as observed by Guthrie .
He wrote the columns in an exaggerated hillbilly dialect and usually included a small comic ; they were published as a collection after Guthrie 's death .
Steve Earle said of Guthrie , `` I do n't think of Woody Guthrie as a political writer .
He was a writer who lived in very political times .
`` With the outbreak of World War II and the non-aggression pact the Soviet Union had signed with Germany in 1939 , the owners of KFVD radio did not want its staff `` spinning apologia '' for the Soviet Union .
Both Robbin and Guthrie left the station .
Without the daily radio show , his prospects for employment diminished , and Guthrie and his family returned to Pampa , Texas .
Although Mary Guthrie was happy to return to Texas , Guthrie preferred to accept Will Geer 's invitation to New York City and headed east .
=== 1940s : Building a legacy === ==== New York City ==== Arriving in New York , Guthrie , known as `` the Oklahoma cowboy '' , was embraced by its leftist folk music community .
For a time , he slept on a couch in Will Geer 's apartment .
Guthrie made his first recordings—several hours of conversation and songs recorded by the folklorist Alan Lomax for the Library of Congress—as well as an album , Dust Bowl Ballads , for Victor Records in Camden , New Jersey .
In February 1940 he wrote his most famous song , `` This Land Is Your Land '' , as a response to what he felt was an overplaying of Irving Berlin 's `` God Bless America '' on the radio .
Guthrie thought the lyrics were unrealistic and complacent .
He adapted the melody from an old gospel song , `` Oh My Loving Brother '' , which had been adapted by the country group the Carter Family for their song `` When The World 's On Fire '' .
Guthrie signed the manuscript with the comment , `` All you can write is what you see '' .
Although the song was written in 1940 , it was four years before he recorded it for Moses Asch in April 1944 .
Sheet music was produced and given to schools by Howie Richmond sometime later .
In March 1940 Guthrie was invited to play at a benefit hosted by the John Steinbeck Committee to Aid Farm Workers , to raise money for migrant workers .
There he met the folksinger Pete Seeger , and the two men became good friends .
Seeger accompanied Guthrie back to Texas to meet other members of the Guthrie family .
He recalled an awkward conversation with Mary Guthrie 's mother , in which she asked for Seeger 's help to persuade Guthrie to treat her daughter better .
From April 1940 Guthrie and Seeger lived together in the Greenwich Village loft of sculptor Harold Ambellan and his fiancee .
Guthrie had some success in New York at this time as a guest on CBS 's radio program Back Where I Come From and used his influence to get a spot on the show for his friend Huddie `` Lead Belly '' Ledbetter .
Ledbetter 's Tenth Street apartment was a gathering spot for the leftwing musician circle in New York at the time , and Guthrie and Ledbetter were good friends , as they had busked together at bars in Harlem .
In November 1941 Seeger introduced Guthrie to his friend the poet Charles Olson , then a junior editor at the fledgling magazine Common Ground .
The meeting led to Guthrie writing the article `` Ear Players '' in the Spring 1942 issue of the magazine .
The article marked Guthrie 's debut as a published writer in the mainstream media .
In September 1940 Guthrie was invited by the Model Tobacco Company to host their radio program Pipe Smoking Time .
Guthrie was paid $ 180 a week , an impressive salary in 1940 .
He was finally making enough money to send regular payments back to Mary .
He also brought her and the children to New York , where the family lived briefly in an apartment on Central Park West .
The reunion represented Woody 's desire to be a better father and husband .
He said , `` I have to set [ sic ] real hard to think of being a dad .
`` Guthrie quit after the seventh broadcast , claiming he had begun to feel the show was too restrictive when he was told what to sing .
Disgruntled with New York , Guthrie packed up Mary and his children in a new car and headed west to California .
Choreographer Sophie Maslow developed Folksay as an elaborate mix of modern dance and ballet , which combined folk songs by Woody Guthrie with text from Carl Sandburg’s 1936 book-length poem The People , Yes .
The premiere took place in March 1942 at the Humphrey-Weidman Studio Theatre in New York City .
Guthrie provided live music for the performance , which featured Maslow and her New Dance Group .
Two-and-a-half years later , Maslow brought Folksay to early television under the direction of Leo Hurwitz .
The same group performed the ballet live in front of CBS TV cameras .
The 30-minute broadcast aired on WCBW , the pioneer CBS television station in New York City ( now WCBS-TV ) , from 8:15-8:45PM ET on November 24th , 1944 .
Featured were Maslow and the New Dance Group , which included among others Jane Dudley , Pearl Pelmus , and William Bales .
Woody Guthrie and fellow folksinger Tony Kraber played guitar , sang songs , and read text from The People , Yes .
The program received positive reviews and was performed on television over WCBW a second time in early 1945 .
==== Pacific Northwest ==== In May 1941 , after a brief stay in Los Angeles , Guthrie moved to Portland , Oregon , in the neighborhood of Lents , on the promise of a job .
Gunther von Fritsch was directing a documentary about the Bonneville Power Administration 's construction of the Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River , and needed a narrator .
Alan Lomax had recommended Guthrie to narrate the film and sing songs onscreen .
The original project was expected to take 12 months , but as filmmakers became worried about casting such a political figure , they minimized Guthrie 's role .
The Department of the Interior hired him for one month to write songs about the Columbia River and the construction of the federal dams for the documentary 's soundtrack .
Guthrie toured the Columbia River and the Pacific Northwest .
Guthrie said he `` could n't believe it , it 's a paradise '' , which appeared to inspire him creatively .
In one month Guthrie wrote 26 songs , including three of his most famous : `` Roll On , Columbia , Roll On '' , `` Pastures of Plenty '' , and `` Grand Coulee Dam '' .
The surviving songs were released as Columbia River Songs .
The film `` Columbia '' was not completed until 1949 ( see below ) .
At the conclusion of the month in Oregon and Washington , Guthrie wanted to return to New York .
Tired of the continual uprooting , Mary Guthrie told him to go without her and the children .
Although Guthrie would see Mary again , once on a tour through Los Angeles with the Almanac Singers , it was essentially the end of their marriage .
Divorce was difficult , since Mary was a member of the Catholic Church , but she reluctantly agreed in December 1943 .
==== Almanac Singers ==== Following the conclusion of his work in the Northwest , Guthrie corresponded with Pete Seeger about Seeger 's newly formed folk-protest group , the Almanac Singers .
Guthrie returned to New York with plans to tour the country as a member of the group .
The singers originally worked out of a loft in New York City hosting regular concerts called `` hootenannies '' , a word Pete and Woody had picked up in their cross-country travels .
The singers eventually outgrew the space and moved into the cooperative Almanac House in Greenwich Village .
Initially Guthrie helped write and sing what the Almanac Singers termed `` peace '' songs ; while the Nazi-Soviet Pact was in effect , until Hitler invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 , the Communist line was that World War II was a capitalist fraud .
After Hitler 's invasion of the Soviet Union , the group wrote anti-fascist songs .
The members of the Almanac Singers and residents of the Almanac House were a loosely defined group of musicians , though the `` core '' members included Guthrie , Pete Seeger , Millard Lampell and Lee Hays .
In keeping with common socialist ideals , meals , chores and rent at the Almanac House were shared .
The Sunday hootenannies were good opportunities to collect donation money for rent .
Songs written in the Almanac House had shared songwriting credits among all the members , although in the case of `` Union Maid '' , members would later state that Guthrie wrote the song , ensuring that his children would receive residuals .
In the Almanac House , Guthrie added authenticity to their work , since he was a `` real '' working class Oklahoman .
`` There was the heart of America personified in Woody ... And for a New York Left that was primarily Jewish , first or second generation American , and was desperately trying to get Americanized , I think a figure like Woody was of great , great importance '' , a friend of the group , Irwin Silber , would say .
Woody routinely emphasized his working-class image , rejected songs he felt were not in the country blues vein he was familiar with , and rarely contributed to household chores .
House member Agnes `` Sis '' Cunningham , another Okie , would later recall that Woody `` loved people to think of him as a real working class person and not an intellectual '' .
Guthrie contributed songwriting and authenticity in much the same capacity for Pete Seeger 's post-Almanac Singers project People 's Songs , a newsletter and booking organization for labor singers , founded in 1945 .
==== Bound for Glory ==== Guthrie was a prolific writer , penning thousands of pages of unpublished poems and prose , many written while living in New York City .
After a recording session with Alan Lomax , Lomax suggested Guthrie write an autobiography .
Lomax thought Guthrie 's descriptions of growing up were some of the best accounts he had read of American childhood .
During this time Guthrie met Marjorie Mazia , a dancer in New York who would become his second wife .
Mazia was an instructor at the prestigious Martha Graham Dance School , where she was assisting Sophie Maslow with her piece Folksay .
Based on the folklore and poetry collected by Carl Sandburg , Folksay included the adaptation of some of Guthrie 's Dust Bowl Ballads for the dance .
Guthrie continued to write songs and began work on his autobiography .
The end product , Bound for Glory , was completed with the patient editing assistance of Mazia and was first published by E.P .
Dutton in 1943 .
It is vividly told in the artist 's down-home dialect , with the flair and imagery of a true storyteller .
Library Journal complained about the `` too careful reproduction of illiterate speech .
`` But Clifton Fadiman , reviewing the book in the New York Times , paid the author a fine tribute : `` Someday people are going to wake up to the fact that Woody Guthrie and the ten thousand songs that leap and tumble off the strings of his music box are a national possession , like Yellowstone and Yosemite , and part of the best stuff this country has to show the world .
`` A film adaptation of Bound for Glory was released in 1976 .
In 1944 Guthrie met Moses `` Moe '' Asch of Folkways Records , for whom he first recorded `` This Land Is Your Land '' .
Over the next few years , he recorded `` Worried Man Blues '' , along with hundreds of other songs .
These recordings would later be released by Folkways and Stinson Records , which had joint distribution rights .
The Folkways recordings are available ( through the Smithsonian Institution online shop ) ; the most complete series of these sessions , culled from dates with Asch , is titled The Asch Recordings .
==== World War II years ==== Guthrie believed performing his anti-fascist songs and poems at home was the best use of his talents ; Guthrie lobbied the United States Army to accept him as a USO performer instead of conscripting him as a soldier in the draft .
When Guthrie 's attempts failed , his friends Cisco Houston and Jim Longhi persuaded Guthrie to join the U.S .
Merchant Marine in June 1943 .
He made several voyages aboard the merchant ships SS William B. Travis , SS William Floyd , and SS Sea Porpoise while they travelled in convoys during the Battle of the Atlantic .
He served as a mess man and dishwasher and frequently sang for the crew and troops to buoy their spirits on transatlantic voyages .
His first ship , William B. Travis , hit a mine in the Mediterranean Sea , killing one person aboard , but made it to Bizerte , Tunisia under her own power .
His last ship , Sea Porpoise , took troops from the United States for the D-Day invasion .
Guthrie was aboard when the ship was torpedoed off Utah Beach by the German submarine U-390 on July 5 , 1944 , injuring 12 of the crew .
Guthrie was unhurt and the ship stayed afloat to be repaired at Newcastle in England before returning to the United States in July 1944 .
He was an active supporter of the National Maritime Union , the main union for wartime American sailors .
Guthrie wrote songs about his experience in the Merchant Marine but was never satisfied with the results .
Longhi later wrote about these experiences in his book Woody , Cisco and Me .
The book offers a rare first-hand account of Guthrie during his Merchant Marine service .
In 1945 , Guthrie 's association with Communism made him ineligible for further service in the Merchant Marine , and he was drafted into the U.S. Army .
While he was on furlough from the Army , Guthrie and Marjorie were married .
After his discharge , they moved into a house on Mermaid Avenue in Coney Island and over time had four children : daughters Cathy and Nora ; and sons Arlo and Joady .
One of their children , Cathy , died as a result of a fire at the age of four , sending Guthrie into a serious depression .
Arlo and Joady followed in their father 's footsteps as singer-songwriters .
During this period , Guthrie wrote and recorded Songs to Grow on for Mother and Child , a collection of children 's music , which includes the song `` Goodnight Little Arlo ( Goodnight Little Darlin ' ) '' , written when Arlo was about nine years old .
During 1947 he wrote House of Earth , a novel containing explicit sexual material , about a couple who build a house made of clay and earth to withstand the dust bowl 's brutal weather , that he was unable to get published .
It was published in 2013 , by Harper under actor Johnny Depp 's publishing imprint , Infinitum Nihil .
In 1949 , Guthrie 's music was used in the film Columbia River ; Guthrie had been commissioned in 1941 to provide songs for the project , but it had been postponed by World War II .
==== Mermaid Avenue ==== The years living on Mermaid Avenue were among Guthrie 's most productive as a writer .
His extensive writings from this time were archived and maintained by Marjorie and later his estate , mostly handled by his daughter Nora .
Several of the manuscripts contain scribblings by a young Arlo and the other Guthrie offspring .
During this time Ramblin ' Jack Elliott studied extensively under Guthrie , visiting his home and observing how he wrote and performed .
Elliott , like Bob Dylan later , idolized Guthrie and was inspired by his idiomatic performance style and repertoire .
Because of Guthrie 's Huntington 's disease , Dylan and Guthrie 's son Arlo later claimed they learned much of Guthrie 's performance style from Elliott .
When asked about Arlo 's claim , Elliott said , `` I was flattered .
Dylan learned from me the same way I learned from Woody .
Woody did n't teach me .
He just said , If you want to learn something , just steal it—that 's the way I learned from Lead Belly .
`` === 1950s and 1960s === ==== Deteriorating health ==== By the late 1940s , Guthrie 's health was declining , and his behavior was becoming extremely erratic .
He received various diagnoses ( including alcoholism and schizophrenia ) , but in 1952 , it was finally determined that he was suffering from Huntington 's disease , a genetic disorder inherited from his mother .
Believing him to be a danger to their children , Marjorie suggested he return to California without her ; they eventually divorced .
Upon his return to California , Guthrie lived at the Theatricum Botanicum , a summer-stock type theatre founded and owned by Will Geer ; with blacklisted singers and actors , he waited out the anti-communist political climate .
As his health worsened , he met and married his third wife , Anneke Van Kirk .
They had a child , Lorinna Lynn .
The couple moved to Fruit Cove , Florida , briefly .
They lived in a bus on land called Beluthahatchee , owned by his friend Stetson Kennedy .
Guthrie 's arm was hurt in a campfire accident when gasoline used to start the campfire exploded .
Although he regained movement in the arm , he was never able to play the guitar again .
In 1954 , the couple returned to New York .
Shortly after , Anneke filed for divorce , a result of the strain of caring for Guthrie .
Anneke left New York and allowed friends to adopt Lorinna Lynn .
Lorinna had no further contact with her birth parents and died in a car accident in California in 1973 at the age of 19 .
After the divorce , Guthrie 's second wife , Marjorie , re-entered his life and cared for him until his death .
Increasingly unable to control his muscles , Guthrie was hospitalized at Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital in Morris County , New Jersey , from 1956 to 1961 , at Brooklyn State Hospital ( now Kingsboro Psychiatric Center ) in East Flatbush until 1966 , and finally at Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in Queens Village , New York , until his death in 1967 .
Marjorie and the children visited Guthrie at Greystone every Sunday .
They answered fan mail and played on the hospital grounds .
Eventually a longtime fan of Guthrie invited the family to his nearby home for the Sunday visits .
This lasted until Guthrie was moved to the Brooklyn State Hospital , which was closer to Howard Beach , NY , where Marjorie and the children then lived .
During the final few years of his life Guthrie was largely alone except for family .
The progression of Huntington 's threw Guthrie into extreme emotional states causing him to lash out at those nearby and to damage a prized book collection of Anneke 's .
These actions mirrored common symptoms of Huntington 's including uncharacteristic aggression , emotional volatility , and social disinhibition .
Guthrie 's illness was essentially untreated , because of a lack of information about the disease .
His death helped raise awareness of the disease and led Marjorie to help found the Committee to Combat Huntington 's Disease , which became the Huntington 's Disease Society of America .
None of Guthrie 's three remaining children with Marjorie have developed symptoms of Huntington 's .
Mary Guthrie 's son Bill died in an auto-train accident in Pomona , California , at the age of 23 .
Mary 's other children , Gwendolyn and Sue , suffered from the disease and both died at 41 years of age .
==== Folk revival and Guthrie 's death ==== In the late 1950s and early 1960s , a new generation of young people was inspired by folk singers such as Guthrie .
These `` folk revivalists '' became more politically aware in their music than those of the previous generation .
The American Folk Revival was beginning to take place , focused on the issues of the day , such as the Civil Rights Movement and Free Speech Movement .
Pockets of folk singers were forming around the country in places such as Cambridge , Massachusetts , and the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York City .
One of Guthrie 's visitors at Greystone Park was the 19-year-old Bob Dylan , who idolized Guthrie .
Dylan wrote of Guthrie 's repertoire : `` The songs themselves were really beyond category .
They had the infinite sweep of humanity in them .
`` After learning of Guthrie 's whereabouts , Dylan regularly visited him .
Guthrie died of complications of Huntington 's disease on October 3 , 1967 .
By the time of his death , his work had been discovered by a new audience , introduced to them through Dylan , Pete Seeger , Ramblin ' Jack Elliott , his ex-wife Marjorie and other new members of the folk revival , and his son Arlo .
A demonstration copy of Arlo 's magnum opus `` Alice 's Restaurant '' was , according to a Guthrie `` family joke , '' the last thing Woody heard before he died .
== Personal life == Guthrie was married three times and fathered eight children , including American folk musician Arlo Guthrie .
Married : Mary Esta Jennings ( 1933–1943 ) , Marjorie Greenblatt Mazia ( 1945–1953 ) , Anneke van Kirk ( 1953–1954 ) Children ( 8 ) : Gwendolyn Gail ( 1935–1976 ) , Sue ( 1937–1978 ) , Bill ( 1939–1962 ) , Cathy Ann ( 1943–1947 ) , Arlo Davy ( 1947– ) , Joady Ben ( 1948– ) , Nora ( 1950– ) , Lorinna Lynn ( 1954–1973 ) Grandfather of musician Sarah Lee Guthrie == Musical legacy == === Woody Guthrie Foundation === The Woody Guthrie Foundation is a non-profit organization that serves as administrator and caretaker of the Woody Guthrie Archives .
The archives house the largest collection of Guthrie material in the world .
In 2013 , the archives were relocated from New York City to the Woody Guthrie Center in Tulsa , Oklahoma , after being purchased by the Tulsa-based George Kaiser Foundation .
The Center officially opened on April 27 , 2013 .
The Woody Guthrie Center features , in addition to the archives , a museum focused on the life and the influence of Guthrie through his music , writings , art , and political activities .
The museum is open to the public ; the archives are open only to researchers by appointment .
The archives contains thousands of items related to Guthrie , including original artwork , books , correspondence , lyrics , manuscripts , media , notebooks , periodicals , personal papers , photographs , scrapbooks , and other special collections .
Guthrie 's unrecorded written lyrics housed at the archives have been the starting point of several albums including the Wilco and Billy Bragg albums Mermaid Avenue and Mermaid Avenue Vol .
II , created in 1998 sessions at the invitation of Guthrie 's daughter Nora .
The Native American ( Diné ) trio Blackfire also interpreted previously unreleased Guthrie lyrics at Nora 's invitation .
Jonatha Brooke 's 2008 album , The Works , includes lyrics from the Woody Guthrie Archives set to music by Jonatha Brooke .
The various artists compilation Note of Hope : A Celebration of Woody Guthrie was released in 2011 .
Nora selected Jay Farrar , Will Johnson , Anders Parker , and Yim Yames to record her father 's lyrics for New Multitudes to honor the 100th anniversary of his birth and a box set of the Mermaid Avenue sessions was also released .
=== Folk Festival === The Woody Guthrie Folk Festival is held annually in mid-July to commemorate Guthrie 's life and music .
The festival is held on the weekend closest to Guthrie 's birth date ( July 14 ) in Guthrie 's hometown of Okemah , Oklahoma .
Planned and implemented annually by the Woody Guthrie Coalition , a non-profit corporation , the goal is simply to ensure Guthrie 's musical legacy .
The Woody Guthrie Coalition commissioned a local Creek Indian sculptor to cast a full-body bronze statue of Guthrie and his guitar , complete with the guitar 's well-known inscription : `` This machine kills fascists '' .
The statue , sculpted by artist Dan Brook , stands along Okemah 's main street in the heart of downtown and was unveiled in 1998 , the inaugural year of the festival .
=== Jewish songs === Marjorie Mazia was born Marjorie Greenblatt and her mother , Aliza Greenblatt , was a well-known Yiddish poet .
With her , Guthrie wrote numerous Jewish lyrics .
Guthrie 's Jewish lyrics can be traced to the unusual collaborative relationship he had with his mother-in-law , who lived across from Guthrie and his family in Brooklyn in the 1940s .
Guthrie ( the Oklahoma troubadour ) and Greenblatt ( the Jewish wordsmith ) often discussed their artistic projects and critiqued each other 's works , finding common ground in their shared love of culture and social justice , despite very different backgrounds .
Their collaboration flourished in 1940s Brooklyn , where Jewish culture was interwoven with music , modern dance , poetry and anti-fascist , pro-labor , classic socialist activism .
Guthrie was inspired to write songs that came directly out of this unlikely relationship , both personal and political ; he identified the problems of Jews with those of his fellow Okies and other oppressed peoples .
These lyrics were rediscovered by Nora Guthrie and were set to music by the Jewish Klezmer group The Klezmatics with the release of Happy Joyous Hanukkah on JMG Records in 2007 .
The Klezmatics also released Wonder Wheel – Lyrics by Woody Guthrie , an album of spiritual lyrics put to music composed by the band .
The album , produced by Danny Blume , was awarded a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary World Music Album .
=== Tributes === Since his death , artists have paid tribute to Guthrie by covering his songs or by dedicating songs to him .
On January 20 , 1968 , three months after Guthrie 's death , Harold Leventhal produced A Tribute to Woody Guthrie at New York City 's Carnegie Hall .
Performers included Jack Elliott , Pete Seeger , Tom Paxton , Bob Dylan and The Band , Judy Collins , Arlo Guthrie , Richie Havens , Odetta , and others .
Leventhal repeated the tribute on September 12 , 1970 , at the Hollywood Bowl .
Recordings of both concerts were eventually released as LPs and later combined into one CD .
The Irish folk singer Christy Moore was also strongly influenced by Woody Guthrie in his seminal 1972 album Prosperous , giving renditions of `` The Ludlow Massacre '' and Bob Dylan 's `` Song to Woody '' .
Dylan also penned the poem Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie as a tribute .
Andy Irvine–Moore 's band mate in Irish folk group Planxty and lifelong admirer of Guthrie–wrote his tribute song `` Never Tire of the Road '' ( released on the album Rain on the Roof ) , which includes the chorus from a song Guthrie recorded in March 1944 : `` You Fascists Are Bound to Lose '' .
In 1986 , Irvine also recorded both parts of Guthrie 's `` The Ballad of Tom Joad '' together as a complete song–under the title of `` Tom Joad '' –on the first album released by his other band , Patrick Street .
Bruce Springsteen also performed a cover of Guthrie 's `` This Land is Your Land '' on his live album Live 1975–1985 .
In the introduction to the song , Springsteen referred to it as `` just about one of the most beautiful songs ever written .
`` In 1979 Sammy Walker 's LP Songs From Woody 's Pen was released by Folkways Records .
Though the original recordings of these songs date back more than 30 years , Walker sings them in a traditional folk-revivalist manner reminiscent of Guthrie’s social conscience and sense of humor .
Speaking of Guthrie , Walker said : `` I can’t think of hardly anyone who has had as much influence on my own singing and songwriting as Woody .
`` In September 1996 Cleveland 's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum and Case Western Reserve University cohosted Hard Travelin ' : The Life and Legacy of Woody Guthrie , a 10-day conference of panel sessions , lectures , and concerts .
The conference became the first in what would become the museum 's annual American Music Masters Series conference .
Highlights included Arlo Guthrie 's keynote address , a Saturday night musical jamboree at Cleveland 's Odeon Theater , and a Sunday night concert at Severance Hall , the home of the Cleveland Orchestra .
Musicians performing over the course of the conference included Arlo Guthrie , Bruce Springsteen , Billy Bragg , Pete Seeger , Ramblin ' Jack Elliott , the Indigo Girls , Ellis Paul , Jimmy LaFave , Ani DiFranco , and others .
In 1999 , Wesleyan University Press published a collection of essays from the conference and DiFranco 's record label , Righteous Babe , released a compilation of the Severance Hall concert , 'Til We Outnumber 'Em , in 2000 .
From 1999 to 2002 the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service presented the traveling exhibit , This Land Is Your Land : The Life and Legacy of Woody Guthrie .
In collaboration with Nora Guthrie , the Smithsonian exhibition draws from rarely seen objects , illustrations , film footage , and recorded performances to reveal a complex man who was at once poet , musician , protester , idealist , itinerant hobo , and folk legend .
In 2003 , Jimmy LaFave produced a Woody Guthrie tribute show called Ribbon of Highway , Endless Skyway .
The ensemble show toured around the country and included a rotating cast of singer-songwriters individually performing Guthrie 's songs .
Interspersed between songs were Guthrie 's philosophical writings read by a narrator .
In addition to LaFave , members of the rotating cast included Ellis Paul , Slaid Cleaves , Eliza Gilkyson , Joel Rafael , husband-wife duo Sarah Lee Guthrie ( Woody Guthrie 's granddaughter ) and Johnny Irion , Michael Fracasso , and The Burns Sisters .
Oklahoma songwriter Bob Childers , sometimes called `` the Dylan of the Dust '' , served as narrator .
When word spread about the tour , performers began contacting LaFave , whose only prerequisite was to have an inspirational connection to Guthrie .
Each artist chose the Guthrie songs that he or she would perform as part of the tribute .
LaFave said , `` It works because all the performers are Guthrie enthusiasts in some form '' .
The inaugural performance of the Ribbon of Highway tour took place on February 5 , 2003 at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville .
The abbreviated show was a featured segment of Nashville Sings Woody , yet another tribute concert to commemorate the music of Woody Guthrie held during the Folk Alliance Conference .
The cast of Nashville Sings Woody , a benefit for the Woody Guthrie Foundation and Archives , also included Arlo Guthrie , Marty Stuart , Nanci Griffith , Guy Clark , Ramblin ' Jack Elliott , Janis Ian , and others .
Woody and Marjorie Guthrie were honored at a musical celebration featuring Billy Bragg and the band Brad on October 17 , 2007 at Webster Hall in New York City .
Steve Earle also performed .
The event was hosted by actor/activist Tim Robbins to benefit the Huntington 's Disease Society of America to commemorate the organization 's 40th Anniversary .
In `` I 'm Not There '' , a 2007 biographical movie about Bob Dylan , one of the characters introduced in the film as segments of Dylan 's life is a young African-American boy who calls himself `` Woody Guthrie '' .
The purpose of this particular character was a reference to Dylan 's youthful obsession with Guthrie .
The fictional Woody also reflects the fictitious autobiographies that Dylan constructed during his early career as he established his own artistic identity .
In the film there is even a scene where the fictional Woody visits the real Woody Guthrie as he lies ill and dying in a hospital in New York ( a reference to the times when a nineteen-year-old Dylan would regularly visit his idol , after learning of his whereabouts , while he was hospitalized in New York in the 1960s ) .
Pete Seeger had the Sloop Woody Guthrie built for an organization he founded , the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater .
It was launched in 1978 .
Now operated by the Beacon Sloop Club , it serves to educate people about sailing and the history and environs of the Hudson River .
In 1988 he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , and in 2000 he was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award .
In 1987 , `` Roll on Columbia '' was chosen as the official Washington State Folk Song , and in 2001 Guthrie 's `` Oklahoma Hills '' was chosen to be the official state folk song of Oklahoma .
Guthrie was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame in 1997 .
On June 26 , 1998 , as part of its Legends of American Music series , the United States Postal Service issued 45 million 32-cent stamps honoring folk musicians Huddie Ledbetter , Guthrie , Sonny Terry and Josh White .
The four musicians were represented on sheets of 20 stamps .
In July 2001 , CB 's Gallery in New York City began hosting an annual Woody Guthrie Birthday Bash concert featuring multiple performers .
This event moved to the Bowery Poetry Club in 2007 after CB 's Gallery and CBGB , its parent club , closed .
The final concert in the series took place on July 14 , 2012 , Guthrie 's 100th birthday .
In 2006 , The Klezmatics set Jewish lyrics written by Guthrie to music .
The resulting album , Wonder Wheel , won the Grammy award for best contemporary world music album .
Also in 2006 , Guthrie was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame .
On February 10 , 2008 , The Live Wire : Woody Guthrie in Performance 1949 , a rare live recording released in cooperation with the Woody Guthrie Foundation , was the recipient of a Grammy Award in the category Best Historical Album .
Less than two years later , Guthrie was again nominated for a Grammy in the same category with the 2009 release of My Dusty Road on Rounder Records .
In the centennial year of Guthrie 's birth another album of newly composed songs on his lyrics has been released : New Multitudes .
On March 10 , 2012 , there was a tribute concert at the Brady Theater in Tulsa , Oklahoma .
John Mellencamp , Arlo Guthrie , Sarah Lee Guthrie & Johnny Irion , the Del McCoury Band and the Flaming Lips performed .
The Grammy Museum held a tribute week in April 2012 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame a tribute in June .
A four-disc box Mermaid Avenue : The Complete Sessions by Billy Bragg and Wilco , with 17 unreleased songs and a documentary , was planned for April release .
On July 10 , 2012 , Smithsonian Folkways released the Woody at 100 : The Woody Guthrie Centennial Collection , a 150-page large-format book with three CDs containing 57 tracks .
The set also contains 21 previously unreleased performances and six never before released original songs , including Woody 's first known—and recently discovered—recordings from 1937 .
The box set received two nominations for the 55th Annual Grammy Awards , including Best Historical Album and Best Boxed Or Special Limited Edition Package .
It also won an Independent Music Award for Best Compilation Album in 2013 .

World music ( also called global music or international music ) is a musical category encompassing many different styles of music from around the globe , which includes many genres including some forms of Western music represented by folk music , as well as selected forms of ethnic music , indigenous music , neotraditional music , and music where more than one cultural tradition , such as ethnic music and Western popular music , intermingle .
World music 's inclusive nature and elasticity as a musical category may pose for some obstacles to a universal definition , but its ethic of interest in the culturally exotic is encapsulated in fRoots magazine 's description of the genre as `` local music from out there '' .
The term was popularized in the 1980s as a marketing category for non-Western traditional music .
Globalization has facilitated the expansion of world music 's audiences and scope .
It has grown to include hybrid subgenres such as world fusion , global fusion , ethnic fusion , and worldbeat .
== Terminology == The term has been credited to ethnomusicologist Robert E. Brown , who coined it in the early 1960s at Wesleyan University in Connecticut , where he developed undergraduate through the doctoral programs in the discipline .
To enhance the process of learning , he invited more than a dozen visiting performers from Africa and Asia and began a world music concert series .
The term became current in the 1980s as a marketing/classificatory device in the media and the music industry .
There are several conflicting definitions for world music .
One is that it consists of `` all the music in the world '' , though such a broad definition renders the term virtually meaningless .
The term also is taken as a classification of music that combines Western popular music styles with one of many genres of non-Western music that are also described as folk music or ethnic music .
However , world music is not exclusively traditional folk music .
It may include cutting edge pop music styles as well .
Succinctly , it can be described as `` local music from out there '' , or `` someone else 's local music '' .
It is a very nebulous term with an increasing number of genres that fall under the umbrella of world music to capture musical trends of combined ethnic style and texture , including Western elements ( examples noted in this section ) .
World music may incorporate distinctive non-Western scales , modes and/or musical inflections , and often features distinctive traditional ethnic instruments , such as the kora ( West African harp ) , the steel drum , the sitar or the didgeridoo .
Music from around the world exerts wide cross-cultural influence as styles naturally influence one another , and in recent years world music has also been marketed as a successful genre in itself .
Academic study of world music , as well as the musical genres and individual artists associated with it appear in such disciplines as anthropology , folkloristics , performance studies and ethnomusicology .
=== Evolving terminology === In the age of digital music production the increased availability of high-quality , ethnic music samples , sound bites and loops from every known region are commonly used in commercial music production , which has exposed a vast spectrum of indigenous music texture to developing , independent artists .
These influences proliferate quickly in a web-based music industry that is now percolating as a much larger , predominantly self-promoted menu , via an increasing number of indie-artist-friendly , streaming Internet options , such as Last.fm , Rhapsody , Live365 , Jango Artist Airplay and ReverbNation .
An amalgamation of roots music in the global , contemporary listening palette has become apparent , which weakens the role major entertainment labels can play in the cultural perception of genre boundaries .
As a result , definitions of the genre have become particularly varied , and determined by particularly wide-ranging and varied opinions .
Similar terminology between distinctly different sub-categories under primary music genres , such as world , rock and pop can be as ambiguous and confusing to industry moguls as it is to consumers .
This is especially true in the context of world music , where branches of ethnically influenced pop trends are as genre-defined by consumer perception as they are by the music industry forums that govern the basis for categorical distinction .
Academic scholars tend to agree that , in today 's world of consumer music reviews and blogging , global music culture 's public perception is what ultimately distils a prevailing basis for definition from genre ambiguity , regardless of how clearly a category has been outlined by corporate marketing forums and music journalism .
The world music genre 's gradual migration from a clear spectrum of roots music traditions to an extended list of hybrid subgenres is a good example of the motion genre boundaries can exhibit in a globalizing pop culture .
The classic , original definition of world music was in part created to instill a perceived authenticity and distinction between indigenous music traditions and those that eventually become diluted by pop culture , and the modern debate over how possible it is to maintain that perception in the richly diverse genre of world music is ongoing .
In a report on the 2014 globalFEST National Public Radio 's Anastasia Tsioulcas said `` Even within the `` world music '' community , nobody likes the term `` world music .
`` It smacks of all kinds of loaded issues , from cultural colonialism to questions about what 's `` authentic '' and what is n't ( and who might get to police such inquiries ) , and forces an incredible array of styles that do n't have anything in common under the label of `` exotic Other .
`` What 's more : I believe that in many people 's imaginations , `` world music '' means a kind of fairly awful , gloppy , hippy-ish , worldbeat fusion .
It 's a problematic , horrible term that satisfies absolutely no one .
`` == Forms == Examples of popular forms of world music include the various forms of non-European classical music ( e.g .
Japanese koto and Chinese guzheng music , Indian raga music , Tibetan chants ) , Eastern European folk music ( e.g .
the village music of the Balkans , The Mystery Of The Bulgarian Voices ) , Nordic folk music and the many forms of folk and tribal music of the Middle East , Africa , Asia , Oceania , Central and South America , and Indonesian music .
The Breton musician Alan Stivell pioneered the connection between traditional folk music , modern rock music and world music with his 1972 album Renaissance of the Celtic Harp .
At this time , Stivell 's contemporary , Welsh singer-songwriter Meic Stevens popularised Welsh folk music .
Neo-traditional Welsh language music featuring a fusion of modern instruments and traditional instruments such as the Pibgorn and the Welsh harp has been further developed by artists such as Bob Delyn a'r Ebillion .
Lebanese musical pioneer Lydia Canaan fused Middle-Eastern quarter notes and microtones with anglophone folk , and is listed in the catalog of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum 's Library and Archives as the first rock star of the Middle East .
More recently , other Welsh-language bands such as Calan and 9 Bach have achieved international acclaim .
Experimental psychedelic rock group Super Furry Animals 's Welsh-language album Mwng was released in May 2000 and re-released in May 2015 , captures the spirit of World music as 'trying to hang on to something that 's under serious threat from advanced capitalism ' .
The broad category of world music includes isolated forms of ethnic music from diverse geographical regions .
These dissimilar strains of ethnic music are commonly categorized together by virtue of their indigenous roots .
Over the 20th century , the invention of sound recording , low-cost international air travel and common access to global communication among artists and the general public has given rise to a related phenomenon called `` crossover '' music .
Musicians from diverse cultures and locations could readily access recorded music from around the world , see and hear visiting musicians from other cultures and visit other countries to play their own music , creating a melting pot of stylistic influences .
While communication technology allows greater access to obscure forms of music , the pressures of commercialization also present the risk of increasing musical homogeneity , the blurring of regional identities , and the gradual extinction of traditional local music-making practices .
== Hybrid examples == Since the music industry established this term , the fuller scope of what an average music consumer defines as `` world '' music in today 's market has grown to include various blends of ethnic music tradition , style and interpretation , and derivative world music genres have been coined to represent these hybrids , such as World fusion , Global fusion , Ethnic fusion or Worldbeat .
Good examples of hybrid , world fusion are the Irish / West African meld of Afro Celt Sound System , the pan-cultural sound of Aomusic and the jazz / Finnish folk music of Värttinä , each of which bear tinges of contemporary , Western influence—an increasingly noticeable element in the expansion genres of world music .
World fusion / Worldbeat / Ethnic fusion / Global fusion can also blend specific indigenous sounds with more blatant elements of Western pop .
Good examples are Paul Simon 's album Graceland , on which South African Mbaqanga music is heard , Peter Gabriel 's work with Pakistani Sufi singer , Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan , the Deep Forest project , in which vocal loops from West Africa are blended with Western , contemporary rhythmic textures and harmony structure , and the work of Mango , who combined pop and rock music with world elements .
More recent bands who exhibit experimentation with World music Hybrid Forms include Vampire Weekend , The Very Best , Island Cassettes & Yeasayer , many of which cite inspiration from the work of Paul Simon .
Depending on style and context , world music can sometimes share the new-age music genre , which is a category that often includes Ambient music and textural expressions from indigenous roots sources .
Good examples are Tibetan bowls , Tuvan throat singing , Gregorian chant or Native American flute music .
World music blended with new-age music is a sound , loosely classified as the hybrid genre , ethnic fusion .
Examples of ethnic fusion are Nicholas Gunn 's `` Face-to-Face '' from Beyond Grand Canyon , featuring authentic Native American flute combined with synthesizers , and `` Four Worlds '' from The Music of the Grand Canyon , featuring spoken word from Razor Saltboy of the Navajo Indian Nation .
=== World fusion === The subgenre world fusion is often mistakenly assumed to refer exclusively to a blending of Western jazz fusion elements with world music .
Although such a hybrid expression falls easily into the world fusion category , the suffix `` fusion '' in the term world fusion should not be assumed to mean only jazz fusion .
Western jazz combined with strong elements of world music is more accurately termed world fusion jazz , ethnic jazz or non-Western jazz .
World fusion and global fusion are nearly synonymous with the genre term worldbeat , and though these are considered subgenres of popular music , they may also imply universal expressions of the more general term , world music .
Throughout the 1970s and 80s , fusion in the jazz music genre implied a blending of jazz and rock music , which is where the misleading assumption is rooted .
== Popular non-Western genres == Although it primarily describes traditional music , the world music category also includes popular music from non-Western urban communities ( e.g .
South African `` township '' music ) and non-European music forms that have been influenced by other so-called third-world musics ( e.g .
Afro-Cuban music ) , although Western-style popular song sourced from non-English-speaking countries in Europe ( e.g .
French pop music ) would not generally be considered world music .
Paris is one of the great European capitals for world music .
For many years , the city has attracted numerous musicians from former colonies in West and North Africa .
This scene is aided by the fact that there are many concerts and institutions that help promote the music .
Algerian and Moroccan music have an important presence in the French capital .
Hundreds of thousands of Algerian and Moroccan immigrants have settled in Paris , bringing the sounds of Amazigh ( Berber ) , raï , and Gnawa music .
Algerian raï also found a large French audience .
The West African community is also very large , integrated by people from Senegal , Mali , Ivory Coast , and Guinea .
They have introduced manding jeli music , mbalax and other styles .
== After 1987 : Women and beyond == One origin of the term was the initiation of World Music Day ( Fête de la Musique ) in 1982 in France .
World Music Day has been celebrated on 21 June every year since then .
On 29 June 1987 a meeting of interested parties gathered to capitalize on the marketing of this genre .
Arguably popular interest was sparked with the release in 1986 of Paul Simon 's Graceland album .
The concept behind the album was to express his own sensibilities using the sounds he had fallen in love with while listening to artists from Southern Africa , including Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Savuka .
This project and the work of Peter Gabriel and Johnny Clegg among others had , to some degree , introduced non-Western music to a wider audience .
They saw this as an opportunity .
Zila Khan is one of today 's leading singers in World Music .
Before 1987 , world music had a following but it was still difficult for interested parties to sell their music to the larger music stores .
Although specialist music stores had been important in developing the genre over many years , the record companies , broadcasters and journalists had been finding it difficult to build a following because the music , itself , seemed too scarce .
However , they were aware that the jazz and classical markets had developed a crossover audience .
They decided the best way forward would be a collective strategy to bring the music to a wider audience .
At around this time , Cultural Co-operation started the Music Village Festival .
This regular series of free world music festivals continues to run .
They also started a network of world music artists to help promote their work .
=== 1987 meeting === At the outset of the 1987 meeting , the musician Roger Armstrong advised the reason why something had to be done : [ He ] felt that the main problem in selling our kind of material lay with the UK retail outlets and , specifically , the fact that they did not know how to rack it coherently .
This discouraged [ the retail stores ] from stocking the material in any depth and made it more difficult for the record buyers to become acquainted with our catalogs .
The first concern of the meetings was to select the umbrella name that this music would be listed under .
Suggestions included `` world beat '' and prefixing words such as `` hot '' or `` tropical '' to existing genre titles .
`` World music '' won after a show of hands , but initially it was not meant to be the title for a whole new genre—but just something the record labels could place on record sleeves to distinguish them during the forthcoming campaign .
Afterward , they agreed that despite the publicity campaign , this was n't an exclusive club—and that for the good of all , any label that sold this type of music could use the name .
Another issue was the distribution methods at the time .
Most main labels were unhappy with the lack of specialist knowledge in their sales force , which led to poor service .
Many larger outlets were reluctant to carry the music , because they favored larger releases they could promote within the store .
It was difficult to justify a large presentation expense with limited stock going into stores .
== Marketing == One of the marketing strategies used in the vinyl market at the time was the use of browser cards , which would appear in the record racks .
As part of the `` world music '' campaign , it was decided that these would be a two color affair designed to carry a special offer package ; to aid the retailer a selection of labels would also be included , presumably for shelf or rack edging .
In an unprecedented move , all of the world music labels coordinated together and developed a compilation cassette for the cover of the music magazine NME .
The overall running time was 90 minutes , each package containing a mini-catalog showing the other releases on offer .
By the time of a second meeting it became clear that a successful campaign required its own dedicated press officer .
The press officer would be able to juggle various deadlines and sell the music as a concept—not just to national stations , but also regional DJs keen to expand their musical variety .
DJs were a key resource as it was important to make `` world music '' important to people outside London—most regions after all had a similarly heritage to tap into .
A cost-effective way of achieving all this would be a leafleting campaign .
The next step was to develop a world music chart , gathering together selling information from around fifty shops , so that it would finally be possible to see which were big sellers in the genre—so new listeners could see what was particularly popular .
It was agreed that the NME could again be involved in printing the chart and also Music Week and the London listings magazine City Limits .
It was also suggested that Andy Kershaw might be persuaded to do a run down of this chart on his show regularly .
== Relationship to immigration and multiculturalism == In most wealthy industrialized countries , large amounts of immigration from other regions has been ongoing for many decades .
This has introduced non-Western music to Western audiences not only as `` exotic '' imports , but also as local music played by fellow citizens .
Caribbean music in the United Kingdom or Chicano rock in the United States would be two obvious examples .
But the process is ongoing and continues to produce new forms .
In the 2010s several musicians from immigrant communities in the West rose to global popularity , such as Haitian-American Wyclef Jean , Somali-Canadian K'naan , Tamil-Briton M.I.A. , or Lebanese-Colombian Shakira , often blending the music of their heritage with hip-hop or pop .
Cuban-born singer-songwriter Addys Mercedes started of her international career from Germany mixing traditional elements of Son with pop .
The diverse nature of major Western cities has changed the pace of musical intermixing .
Once , an established Western artist might collaborate with an established African artist to produce an album or two .
Now , new bands and new genres are built from the ground up by young performers .
For example , the Punjabi-Irish fusion band Delhi 2 Dublin is from neither India nor Ireland , but Vancouver , Canada .
Country for Syria , an Istanbul based music collective , blends American Country music with the music of Syrian refugees and local Turkish music .
In Vancouver , musicians and composers also work collectively to create original compositions for various combinations of ethnic and western instruments .
The JUNO nominated Orchid Ensemble is a trio of two Chinese instruments and the marimba ( plus other percussion instruments ) .
It has been touring across North American since 1997 .
The Vancouver Inter-Cultural Orchestra stages musicians and instruments from China , Taiwan , India , Iran , Africa , Vietnam , ... . with Canadian western orchestral players .
There is also Canada 's most famous Traditional Indian Classical Musician , Cassius Khan who is an award winning internationally renowned as the world 's only Ghazal singer who accompanies himself on the Tabla a two piece hand drum indigenous to India .
Khan himself has not made his views unknown on his dislike to Robert E Brown 's term `` World Music '' by publicly stating he found the term `` Colonial and Oppressing '' and he has been a hot issue in most underground meetings of the musical elites in Canada .
== World Music Month == The World Music Month was designated on October 1987 .
It is a music festival held at the Town & Country Club in London , and it was the start of the winter season for both WOMAD and Arts Worldwide .
The main press release stressed the issues inherent in the campaign .
Since the early 1980s the enthusiasm for music from 'outside ' Western pop culture has been steadily mounting .
More and more international artists , many of whom are big stars in their own countries , are coming to England and North America on tour .
They started off , like the Bhundu Boys , playing small clubs and pubs , but now many acts are so popular that they are filling larger venues .
Examples of radio shows that feature world music include World of Music on Voice of America , Transpacific Sound Paradise on WFMU , The Planet on Australia 's ABC Radio National , DJ Edu presenting D.N.A : DestiNation Africa on BBC Radio 1Xtra , Adil Ray on the BBC Asian Network , Andy Kershaw 's show on BBC Radio 3 and Charlie Gillett 's show on the BBC World Service .
== 2010s radio programs == World music radio programs today often play African hip hop or reggae artists , crossover Bhangra and Latin American jazz groups , etc .
Common media for world music include public radio , webcasting , the BBC , NPR , and ABC ( Australian Broadcasting Corporation ) .
The scope of what is considered world music has increased .
By default , non-region-specific or multi-cultural world music projects are often listed under the generic category of world music .
== Criticisms == The generally accepted geographic standard for what designates world music is withstanding criticism for its universal asymmetry , where nearly every classifiable region under the term is defined , relative to Western music culture ; this is primarily due to the fact that dominant corporate structures for music distribution and promotion originate in Europe and North America , as do the forums for establishing industry genre categories .
Therefore , in market context , `` ethnic '' music is synthetically defined by a radius that extends from a Western center .
Some musicians and curators of music have come to dislike the term `` world music '' .
To these critics , `` world music '' is a parochial , catch-all marketing term for non-Western music of all genres .
In October 1999 , Luaka Bop label founder and ex-Talking Heads frontman David Byrne wrote an `` I Hate World Music '' editorial in The New York Times explaining his objections to the term .
Byrne argued that the labelling and categorization of other cultures as `` exotic '' serves to attract an insincere consumption and deter other potential consumers .
== Awards == The BBC Radio 3 Awards for World Music was an award given to world music artists between 2002 and 2008 , sponsored by BBC Radio 3 .
The award was thought up by fRoots magazine 's editor Ian Anderson , inspired by the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards .
Award categories included : Africa , Asia/Pacific , Americas , Europe , Mid East and North Africa , Newcomer , Culture Crossing , Club Global , Album of the Year , and Audience Award .
Initial lists of nominees in each category were selected annually by a panel of several thousand industry experts .
Shortlisted nominees were voted on by a twelve-member jury , which selected the winners in every category except for the Audience Award category .
These jury members were appointed and presided over by the BBC .
The annual awards ceremony was held at the BBC Proms and winners were given an award called a `` Planet '' .
In March 2009 , the BBC made a decision to axe the BBC Radio 3 Awards for World Music .
In response to the BBC 's decision to end its awards program , the British world music magazine Songlines launched the Songlines Music Awards in 2009 `` to recognise outstanding talent in world music '' .
The WOMEX Awards were introduced in 1999 to honor the high points of world music on an international level and to acknowledge musical excellence , social importance , commercial success , political impact and lifetime achievement .
Every October at the WOMEX event , the award figurine—an ancient mother goddess statue dating back about 6000 years to the Neolithic age—is presented in an award ceremony to a worthy member of the world music community .
== Festivals == Many festivals are identified as being `` world music '' ; here is a small representative selection : The WOMAD Foundation organizes festivals in countries around the world .

Zarzuela ( Spanish pronunciation : [ θarˈθwela ] ) is a Spanish lyric-dramatic genre that alternates between spoken and sung scenes , the latter incorporating operatic and popular song , as well as dance .
The etymology of the name is uncertain , but some propose it may derive from the name of a Royal hunting lodge , the Palacio de la Zarzuela near Madrid , where , allegedly , this type of entertainment was first presented to the court .
The palace was named after the place called `` La Zarzuela '' because of the profusion of brambles ( zarzas ) that grew there , and so the festivities held within the walls became known as `` Zarzuelas '' .
There are two main forms of zarzuela : Baroque zarzuela ( c. 1630–1750 ) , the earliest style , and Romantic zarzuela ( c. 1850–1950 ) , which can be further divided into two .
Main subgenres are género grande and género chico , although other sub-divisions exist .
Zarzuela spread to the Spanish colonies , and many Hispanic countries – notably Cuba – developed their own traditions .
There is also a strong tradition in the Philippines where it is also known as sarswela/sarsuela .
Other regional and linguistic variants in Spain include the Basque zartzuela and the Catalan sarsuela .
A masque-like musical theatre had existed in Spain since the time of Juan del Encina .
The zarzuela genre was innovative in giving a dramatic function to the musical numbers , which were integrated into the argument of the work .
Dances and choruses were incorporated as well as solo and ensemble numbers , all to orchestral accompaniment .
== Baroque zarzuela == In 1657 at the Royal Palace of El Prado , King Philip IV of Spain , Queen Mariana and their court attended the first performance of a new comedy by Pedro Calderón de la Barca , with music by Juan Hidalgo de Polanco titled El Laurel de Apolo ( The Laurels of Apollo ) .
El Laurel de Apolo traditionally symbolises the birth of a new musical genre that had become known as La Zarzuela .
Like Calderón de la Barca 's earlier El golfo de las sirenas ( The Sirens ' Gulf , 1657 ) , El Laurel de Apolo mixed mythological verse drama with operatic solos , popular songs and dances .
The characters in these early , baroque zarzuelas were a mixture of gods , mythological creatures and rustic or pastoral comedy characters ; Antonio de Literes 's popular Acis y Galatea ( 1708 ) is yet another example .
Unlike some other operatic forms , there were spoken interludes , often in verse .
== Italian influence == In 18th-century Bourbon Spain , Italian artistic style dominated in the arts , including Italian opera .
Zarzuela , though still written to Spanish texts , changed to accommodate the Italian vogue .
During the reign of King Charles III , political problems provoked a series of revolts against his Italian ministers ; these were echoed in theatrical presentations .
The older style zarzuela fell out of fashion , but popular Spanish tradition continued to manifest itself in shorter works , such as the single-scene tonadilla ( or intermezzo ) of which the finest literary exponent was Ramón de la Cruz .
Musicians such as Antonio Rodríguez de Hita were proficient in the shorter style of works , though he also wrote a full-scale zarzuela with de la Cruz entitled Las segadoras de Vallecas ( The Reapers of Vallecas , 1768 ) .
José Castel was one of several composers to write for the Teatro del Príncipe .
== 19th century == In the 1850s and 1860s a group of patriotic writers and composers led by Francisco Barbieri and Joaquín Gaztambide revived the zarzuela form , seeing in it a possible release from French and Italian music hegemony .
The elements of the work continue to be the same : sung solos and choruses , spiced with spoken scenes , and comedic songs , ensembles and dances .
Costume dramas and regional variations abound , and the librettos ( though often based on French originals ) are rich in Spanish idioms and popular jargon .
The zarzuelas of the day included in their librettos various regionalisms and popular slang , such as that of Madrid castizos .
Often , the success of a work was due to one or more songs that the public came to know and love .
Despite some modifications the basic structure of the zarzuela remained the same : dialogue scenes , songs , choruses , and comic scenes generally performed by two actor-singers .
The culminating masterpieces from this period were Barbieri 's Pan y toros and Gaztambide 's El juramento .
Another notable composer from this period was Emilio Arrieta .
== Romantic zarzuela == After the Glorious Revolution of 1868 , the country entered a deep crisis ( especially economically ) , which was reflected in theatre .
The public could not afford high-priced theatre tickets for grandiose productions , which led to the rise of the Teatros Variedades ( `` variety theatres '' ) in Madrid , with cheap tickets for one-act plays ( sainetes ) .
This `` theatre of an hour '' had great success and zarzuela composers took to the new formula with alacrity .
Single-act zarzuelas were classified as género chico ( `` little genre '' ) whilst the longer zarzuelas of three acts , lasting up to four hours , were called género grande ( `` grand genre '' ) .
Zarzuela grande battled on at the Teatro de la Zarzuela de Madrid , founded by Barbieri and his friends in the 1850s .
A newer theatre , the Apolo , opened in 1873 .
At first it attempted to present the género grande , but it soon yielded to the taste and economics of the time , and became the `` temple '' of the more populist género chico in the late 1870s .
Musical content from this era ranges from full-scale operatic arias ( romanzas ) through to popular songs , and dialogue from high poetic drama to lowlife comedy characters .
There are also many types of zarzuela in between the two named genres , with a variety of musical and dramatic flavours .
Many of the greatest zarzuelas were written in the 1880s and 1890s , but the form continued to adapt to new theatrical stimuli until well into the 20th century .
With the onset of the Spanish Civil War , the form rapidly declined , and the last romantic zarzuelas to hold the stage were written in the 1950s .
Whilst Barbieri produced the greatest zarzuela grande in El barberillo de Lavapiés , the classic exponent of the género chico was his pupil Federico Chueca , whose La gran vía ( composed with Joaquín Valverde Durán ) was a cult success both in Spain and throughout Europe .
The musical heir of Chueca was José Serrano , whose short , one act género chico zarzuelas - notably La canción del olvido , Alma de dios and the much later Los claveles and La dolorosa - form a stylistic bridge to the more musically sophisticated zarzuelas of the 20th Century .
While the zarzuela featured , even glorified popular customs , festivals , and manners of speech , especially those of Madrid , something never found in a zarzuela is social criticism .
The zarzuela celebrated the established order of society ; if it wanted any change it was that progress or change should be slowed or eliminated .
== Twentieth century == From about 1900 , the term género ínfimo ( `` degraded '' or `` low genre '' ) was coined to describe an emerging form of entertainment allied to the revista and comedy musical ( `` revue '' ) : these were musical works similar to the género chico zarzuela but lighter and bolder in their social criticism , with scenes portraying sexual themes and many verbal double entendres .
One popular work from the género ínfimo years is La corte de Faraón ( 1910 ) , by Vicente Lleó , which was based on the French operetta Madame Putiphar .
In the second decade of the century , the influences of Viennese operetta and the English followers of Sullivan such as Lionel Monckton made themselves felt , in works such as Molinos de viento and El asombro de Damasco ( both by Pablo Luna ) , before the Spanish tradition great acts was reasserted in Amadeu Vives 's Doña Francisquita ( 1923 ) .
The zarzuela continued to flourish in the 1930s , thanks to composers of the stature of Pablo Sorozábal – who reinvigorated it as a vehicle for socio-political comment – Federico Moreno Torroba , and Francisco Alonso .
However , the Spanish Civil War brought a decline of the genre but Rosa de Triana ( 1937 ) or La reina Fea ( 1941 ) of Manuel López Quiroga are greats works , and after the Second World War , its extinction as a live genre was almost total .
There were no new authors and the compositions are not renovated .
There have been no significant new works created since the 1950s ; the existing zarzuela repertoire is costly to produce , and many classics have been performed only sporadically in recent years , at least professionally .
The genre has again found favour in Spain and elsewhere : younger people , in particular , have been drawn to its lyrical music and theatrical spectacle in the 1940s and 1950s .
Spanish radio and television have dedicated time to zarzuela in 1978 , not least in a popular series of programs produced by TVE and entitled Antología de la zarzuela ( `` Zarzuela Anthology '' ) .
These were based on lip syncs of the classic recordings of the 1940s and 1950s .
Some years earlier , impresario José Tamayo worked a theatrical show of the same name which popularized pieces of zarzuela through several national and international tours .
== Zarzuela in Catalonia == While the zarzuela tradition flourished in Madrid and other Spanish cities , Catalonia developed its own zarzuela , with librettos in Catalan .
The atmosphere , the plots , and the music were quite different from the model that triumphed in Madrid ; the Catalan zarzuela was looking to attract a different public , the bourgeois classes .
Catalan zarzuela was turned little by little into what is called , in Catalan , teatre líric català ( `` Catalan lyric theater '' ) , with a personality of its own , and with modernista lyricists and composers such as Enric Granados or Enric Morera .
In the final years of the 19th century , as modernisme emerged , one of the notable modernistas , and one of Felip Pedrell 's pupils , Amadeu Vives came onto the Barcelona scene .
He contributed to the creation of the Orfeó Català in 1891 , along with Lluís Millet .
In spite of a success sustained over many years , his musical ambition took him to Madrid , where zarzuela had a higher profile .
Vives became one of the most important zarzuela composers , with such masterpieces as Doňa Francisquita , La villana ( both based on plays by Lope de Vega ) and the through-written opera in zarzuela style Maruxa .
== Zarzuela in Cuba and the Philippines == In Cuba the afrocubanismo zarzuelas of Ernesto Lecuona ( María la O ; El cafetal ) , Eliseo Grenet ( La virgen morena ) and Gonzalo Roig ( Cecilia Valdés , based on Cirilo Villaverde 's classic novel ) represent a brief golden age of political and cultural importance .
These and other works centred on the plight of the mulata woman and other black underclasses in Cuban society .
The outstanding star of many of these productions was Rita Montaner .
Mexico and the Philippines likewise had their own zarzuela traditions .
In the Philippines , the zarzuela ( or sarsuwela ) was supported financially by First Lady Imelda Marcos .
In addition , Zarzuela Ilocana have been staged in the Ilokano language .
== Recorded zarzuela == From 1950 onwards , zarzuela prospered in a series of LP recordings from EMI , Hispavox and others , with worldwide distribution .
A series produced by the Alhambra company of Madrid , the majority conducted by the leading Spanish conductor Ataulfo Argenta had particular success .
Many featured singers soon to become world-famous , such as Teresa Berganza , Alfredo Kraus and Pilar Lorengar ; and later , Montserrat Caballé and Plácido Domingo .
Less known performers such as Ana María Iriarte , Inés Ribadeneira , Toñy Rosado , Carlos Munguía , Renato Cesari , and others frequently lent their voices to the recordings .
The choirs of Orfeón Donostiarra and Singers ' Choir of Madrid also contributed , rounding out the overall quality of the works .
After Argenta 's death others such as Indalecio Cisneros and Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos continued in his footsteps .
There were also recordings made conducted by the composers themselves , such as Pablo Sorozábal and Federico Moreno Torroba .
Many well-known singers , including Victoria de los Angeles and Montserrat Caballé , have recorded albums of zarzuela songs and arias .
Many zarzuela productions are now to be seen on DVD and Blu-ray disc .
In March 2009 , EuroArts released Amor , Vida de Mi Vida , a recording on Blu-ray disc of an August 2007 zarzuela concert by Plácido Domingo and Ana María Martínez , with the Mozarteum Orchestra of Salzburg conducted by Jesús López-Cobos .
In April 2009 , BBC/Opus Arte released a Blu-ray disc of a July 2006 performance of Federico Moreno Torroba 's Luisa Fernanda with Plácido Domingo and Nancy Herrera , recorded at the Teatro Real de Madrid with Jesús López-Cobos conducting .

The Saga Fernández-Shaw and the Lyrical Theatre ( in English and Spanish ]
Emel Mathlouthi ( Arabic : آمال المثلوثي ) ( born January 11 , 1982 ) is a Tunisian singer-songwriter best known for her protest songs `` Ya Tounes Ya Meskina '' ( `` Poor Tunisia '' ) and `` Kelmti Horra '' ( `` My Word is Free '' ) , which became anthems for the Tunisian revolution .
Her first studio album , also titled Kelmti Horra , was released worldwide by Harmonia Mundi in 2012 to critical acclaim .
Her second album , `` Ensen , was released by Partisan Records in 2017 , also to comsiderable acclaim .
== Early life and career == Emel Mathlouthi first began writing songs as a student .
Frustrated by the lack of opportunities and the apathy of her classmates and family , she began writing political songs such as `` Ya Tounes Ya Meskina '' ( `` Poor Tunisia '' ) .
In 2006 she was a finalist in the Prix RMC Moyen-Orient Musique competition .
She decided to move to Paris , France , in 2008 when the Tunisian government banned her songs from radio and TV .
Although banned from Tunisian airwaves , bootlegs of her live performances in France circulated on the internet in Tunisia .
After the death of Mohamed Bouazizi she dedicated an Arabic version of the Joan Baez song `` Here 's To You '' to him .
She was recorded on the Avenue Habib Bourguiba singing `` Kelmti Horra '' to protesters and it became a viral video .
She has given concerts in Egypt and Iraq , and performed in Canada at the Vancouver Folk Music Festival and the Festival du Monde Arabe de Montréal .
At the beginning of July 2012 , she gave a groundbreaking concert in Baghdad , Iraq .
On July 28 she gave a concert at the Sfinks Festival in Belgium , where she received a standing ovation for her cover of the Leonard Cohen song `` Hallelujah '' .
In 2013 , after her first concert in Cairo since the revolution , Ahram Online described her as `` The Fairuz of her generation '' .
She opened for Dead Can Dance in the festival Les nuits de Fourvière in Lyon and performed at the WOMAD Festival at Charlton Parkin the UK .
Israeli authorities refused to let her enter Ramallah to perform , so she sang in front of a camera in Jordan .
The small show was broadcast to the Palestinian audience in a theater in Ramallah .
In 2015 she was invited to perform at both the Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony and The Nobel Peace Prize Concert along with A-ha and Aurora , where she performed two renditions of her song `` Kelmti Horra , '' one accompanied only by a guitarist , Karim Attoumane , and the other with a full orchestra and chorus .
The concert was hosted by Jay Leno , who praised her in the concert press conference as being the first Arabic-language singer to catch his attention .
== Debut album : Kelmti Horra ( My Word Is Free ) == Emel Mathlouthi released her debut , Kelmti Horra , in January 2012 .
The album was influenced by Joan Baez , Massive Attack , and Björk .
As a politically aware musician , the songs in the album have made promising duty to speak out on any injustice that Emel has witnessed about her beloved Tunisia .
While she sings about humanity and a better world , the success of this album has made her to reach many more people in different parts of the world .
As the song , `` Kelmti Horra '' ( My Word is Free ) , was considered as `` the anthem of the Arab Spring , '' it has been Emel 's most famous song so far .
The outstanding success of this songs led her to perform the song on December 11 , 2015 , during the award ceremony of the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo , which was awarded to the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet .
== Second album : Ensen ( Human ) == Ensen ( Human ) , the sophomore album of Emel was released on February 24 , 2017 by Partisan Records .
The album was recorded in seven countries including Iceland , Sweden , France , and the US .
Producers of the album include the former Björk collaborator , Icelandic producer Valgeir Sigurðsson and her main collaborator French/Tunisian producer Amine Metani .
The first single off the album , `` Ensen Dhaif '' ( Human , Helpless Human ) , was named as `` best new track '' by Pitchfork on February 16 , 2016 .
As Mathlouthi explains , the song is dedicated to the `` people that have to carry the weight and all the struggles so that a very small percentage can enjoy the power .

The Ramones were an American punk rock band that formed in the New York City neighborhood of Forest Hills , Queens , in 1974 .
They are often cited as the first band to define the punk-rock sound .
Despite achieving only limited commercial success , the band was a major influence on the 1970s punk movement in both the United States and United Kingdom .
All of the band members adopted pseudonyms ending with the surname `` Ramone '' , although none of them were related .
They performed 2,263 concerts , touring virtually nonstop for 22 years .
In 1996 , after a tour with the Lollapalooza music festival , the band played a farewell concert and disbanded .
By 2014 , all four of the band 's original members , lead singer Joey Ramone ( 1951–2001 ) , bass guitarist Dee Dee Ramone ( 1951–2002 ) , lead guitarist Johnny Ramone ( 1948–2004 ) and drummer Tommy Ramone ( 1949–2014 ) , had died .
Recognition of the band 's importance built over the years , and they are now mentioned in many assessments of all-time great rock music , such as number 26 in the Rolling Stone magazine list of the `` 100 Greatest Artists of All Time '' and number 17 in VH1 's `` 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock '' .
In 2002 , the Ramones were ranked the second-greatest band of all time by Spin magazine , trailing only the Beatles .
On March 18 , 2002 , the original four members and Tommy 's replacement on drums , Marky Ramone , were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .
In 2011 , the group was awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award .
== History == === Formation : 1974–1975 === The original members of the band met in and around the middle-class neighborhood of Forest Hills in the New York City borough of Queens .
John Cummings and Thomas Erdelyi had both been in a high-school garage band from 1965 to 1967 known as the Tangerine Puppets .
They became friends with Douglas Colvin , who had recently moved to the area from Germany , and Jeffrey Hyman , who was the initial lead singer of the glam rock band Sniper , founded in 1972 .
The Ramones began taking shape in early 1974 when Cummings and Colvin invited Hyman to join them in a band .
The initial line-up featured Colvin on lead vocals , rhythm and bass guitars , Cummings on lead guitar , and Hyman on drums .
Hyman soon switched from drums to vocals .
Colvin was the first to adopt the name `` Ramone '' , calling himself Dee Dee Ramone .
He was inspired by Paul McCartney 's use of the pseudonym Paul Ramon during his Silver Beetles days .
Dee Dee convinced the other members to take on the name and came up with the idea of calling the band the Ramones .
Hyman and Cummings became Joey and Johnny Ramone , respectively .
A friend of the band , Monte A. Melnick ( later their tour manager ) , helped to arrange rehearsal time for them at Manhattan 's Performance Studios , where he worked .
Johnny 's former bandmate Erdelyi was set to become their manager .
Soon after the band was formed , Dee Dee realized that he could not sing and play his bass guitar simultaneously ; with Erdelyi 's encouragement , Joey became the band 's new lead singer .
Dee Dee would continue , however , to count off each song 's tempo with his signature rapid-fire shout of `` 1-2-3-4 !
`` Joey soon similarly realized that he could not sing and play drums simultaneously and left the position of drummer .
While auditioning prospective replacements , Erdelyi would often take to the drums and demonstrate how to play the songs .
It became apparent that he was able to perform the group 's music better than anyone else , and he joined the band as Tommy Ramone .
The Ramones played before an audience for the first time on March 30 , 1974 , at Performance Studios .
The songs they played were very fast and very short ; most clocked in at under two minutes .
Around this time , a new music scene was emerging in New York centered on two clubs in downtown Manhattan—Max 's Kansas City and , more famously , CBGB ( usually referred to as CBGB 's ) .
The Ramones made their CBGB debut on August 16 , 1974 .
Legs McNeil , who cofounded Punk magazine the following year , later described the impact of that performance : `` They were all wearing these black leather jackets .
And they counted off this song ... and it was just this wall of noise ...
They looked so striking .
These guys were not hippies .
This was something completely new .
`` The band swiftly became regulars at the club , playing there seventy-four times by the end of the year .
After garnering considerable attention for their performances—which averaged about seventeen minutes from beginning to end—the group was signed to a recording contract in late 1975 by Seymour Stein of Sire Records .
After they were seen by Sire A & R man Craig Leon he brought the band to the attention of the label .
Stein 's wife , Linda Stein , saw the band play at Mothers ; she would later co-manage them along with Danny Fields .
By this time , the Ramones were recognized as leaders of the new scene that was increasingly being referred to as `` punk '' .
The group 's unusual frontman had a lot to do with their impact .
As Dee Dee explained , `` All the other singers [ in New York ] were copying David Johansen [ of the New York Dolls ] , who was copying Mick Jagger ...
But Joey was unique , totally unique .
`` === Spearheading punk : 1976–1977 === The Ramones recorded their debut album , Ramones , in April 1976 .
Of the fourteen songs on the album , the longest , `` I Do n't Wan na Go Down to the Basement '' , barely surpassed two and a half minutes .
While the songwriting credits were shared by the entire band , Dee Dee was the primary writer .
The Ramones album was produced by Sire 's Craig Leon , with Tommy as associate producer , on an extremely low budget of about $ 6,400 and released in April .
The now iconic front cover photograph of the band was taken by Roberta Bayley , a photographer for Punk magazine .
Punk , which was largely responsible for codifying the term for the scene emerging around CBGB , ran a cover story on the Ramones in its third issue , the same month as the record 's release .
The Ramones ' debut LP was greeted by rock critics with glowing reviews .
The Village Voice 's Robert Christgau wrote , `` I love this record—love it—even though I know these boys flirt with images of brutality ( Nazi especially ) ... For me , it blows everything else off the radio '' .
In Rolling Stone , Paul Nelson described it as `` constructed almost entirely of rhythm tracks of an exhilarating intensity rock & roll has not experienced since its earliest days .
`` Characterizing the band as `` authentic American primitives whose work has to be heard to be understood '' , he declared , `` It is time popular music followed the other arts in honoring its primitives .
`` Newsday 's Wayne Robbins simply anointed the Ramones as `` the best young rock 'n ' roll band in the known universe .
`` Despite Sire 's high hopes for it , Ramones was not a commercial success , reaching only number 111 on the Billboard album chart .
The two singles issued from the album , `` Blitzkrieg Bop '' and `` I Wan na Be Your Boyfriend '' , failed to chart .
At the band 's first major performance outside of New York , a June date in Youngstown , Ohio , members of Cleveland punk legends Frankenstein aka the Dead Boys were present and struck up a friendship with the band .
It was n't until they made a brief tour of England that they began to see the fruits of their labor ; a performance at the Roundhouse in London on July 4 , 1976 , second-billed to the Flamin ' Groovies , organized by Linda Stein , was a resounding success .
T-Rex leader Marc Bolan was in attendance at the Roundhouse show and was invited on stage .
Their Roundhouse appearance and a club date the following night—where the band met members of the Sex Pistols and the Clash—helped galvanize the burgeoning UK punk rock scene .
The Flamin ' Groovies/Ramones double bill was successfully reprised at the Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles the following month , fueling the punk scene there as well .
The Ramones were becoming an increasingly popular live act—a Toronto performance in September energized yet another growing punk scene .
Their next two albums , Leave Home and Rocket to Russia , were released in 1977 .
Both were produced by Tommy and Tony Bongiovi , the second cousin of Jon Bon Jovi .
Leave Home met with even less chart success than Ramones , though it did include `` Pinhead '' , which became one of the band 's signature songs with its chanted refrain of `` Gabba gabba hey !
`` Leave Home also included a fast-paced cover of the oldie `` California Sun '' , written by Henry Glover & Morris Levy , and originally recorded by Joe Jones .
Rocket to Russia was the band 's highest-charting album to date , reaching number 49 on the Billboard 200 .
In Rolling Stone , critic Dave Marsh called it `` the best American rock & roll of the year '' .
The album also featured the first Ramones single to enter the Billboard charts ( albeit only as high as number 81 ) : `` Sheena Is a Punk Rocker '' .
The follow-up single , `` Rockaway Beach '' , reached number 66—the highest any Ramones single would ever reach in America .
On December 31 , 1977 the Ramones recorded It 's Alive , a live concert double album , at the Rainbow Theatre , London , which was released in April 1979 ( the title is a reference to the 1974 horror film of the same name ) .
=== Recordings turn more pop : 1978–1983 === Tommy , tired of touring , left the band in early 1978 .
He continued as the Ramones ' record producer under his birth name of Erdelyi .
His position as drummer was filled by Marc Bell , who had been a member of the early 1970s hard rock band Dust , Wayne County and the Backstreet Boys , and the pioneering punk group Richard Hell & the Voidoids .
Bell became Marky Ramone .
Later that year , the band released their fourth studio album , and first with Marky , Road to Ruin .
The album , co-produced by Tommy with Ed Stasium , included some new sounds such as acoustic guitar , several ballads , and the band 's first two recorded songs longer than three minutes .
It failed to reach the Billboard Top 100 .
However , `` I Wan na Be Sedated '' , which appeared both on the album and as a single , would become one of the band 's best-known songs .
The artwork on the album 's cover was done by Punk magazine cofounder John Holmstrom .
After the band 's movie debut in Roger Corman 's Rock 'n ' Roll High School ( 1979 ) , renowned producer Phil Spector became interested in the Ramones and produced their 1980 album End of the Century .
During the recording sessions in Los Angeles , Spector held Johnny at gunpoint , forcing him to repeatedly play a riff .
Though it was to be the highest-charting album in the band 's history—reaching number 44 in the United States and number 14 in Great Britain—Johnny made clear that he favored the band 's more aggressive punk material : `` End of the Century was just watered-down Ramones .
It 's not the real Ramones .
`` This stance was also conveyed by the title and track selection of the compilation album Johnny later oversaw , Loud , Fast Ramones : Their Toughest Hits .
Despite these reservations , Johnny did concede that some of Spector 's work with the band had merit , saying `` It really worked when he got to a slower song like 'Danny Says'—the production really worked tremendously .
'Rock 'N ' Roll Radio ' is really good .
For the harder stuff , it did n't work as well .
`` The syrupy , string-laden Ronettes cover `` Baby , I Love You '' released as a single , became the band 's biggest hit in Great Britain , reaching number 8 on the charts .
Pleasant Dreams , the band 's sixth album , was released in 1981 .
It continued the trend established by End of the Century , taking the band further from the raw punk sound of its early records .
As described by Trouser Press , the album , produced by Graham Gouldman of UK pop act 10cc , moved the Ramones `` away from their pioneering minimalism into heavy metal territory '' .
Johnny would contend in retrospect that this direction was a record company decision , a continued futile attempt to get airplay on American radio .
While Pleasant Dreams reached number 58 on the U.S. chart , its two singles failed to register at all .
Subterranean Jungle , produced by Ritchie Cordell and Glen Kolotkin , was released in 1983 .
According to Trouser Press , it brought the band `` back to where they once belonged : junky '60s pop adjusted for current tastes '' , which among other things meant `` easing off the breakneck rhythm that was once Ramones dogma .
`` Billy Rogers , who had performed with Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers , played drums on the album 's second single , a cover of the Chambers Brothers ' `` Time Has Come Today '' , becoming the only song showing three different drummers : Rogers on recording , Marky on album credits and Richie on video clip .
Subterranean Jungle peaked at number 83 in the United States—it would be the last album by the band to crack the Billboard Top 100 .
In 2002 , Rhino Records released a new version of it with seven bonus tracks .
=== Shuffling members : 1983–1989 === After the release of Subterranean Jungle , Marky was fired from the band due to his alcoholism .
He was replaced by Richard Reinhardt , who adopted the name Richie Ramone .
Joey Ramone remarked that `` [ Richie ] saved the band as far as I 'm concerned .
He 's the greatest thing to happen to the Ramones .
He put the spirit back in the band .
`` Richie is the only Ramones drummer to sing lead vocals on Ramones songs , including `` ( You ) Ca n't Say Anything Nice '' as well as the unreleased `` Elevator Operator '' .
Joey Ramone commented , `` Richie 's very talented and he 's very diverse ...
He really strengthened the band a hundred percent because he sings backing tracks , he sings lead , and he sings with Dee Dee 's stuff .
In the past , it was always just me singing for the most part .
`` Richie was also the only drummer to be the sole composer of Ramones songs including their hit `` Somebody Put Something in My Drink '' as well as `` Smash You '' , `` Humankind '' , `` I 'm Not Jesus '' , `` I Know Better Now '' and `` ( You ) Ca n't Say Anything Nice '' .
Joey Ramone supported Richie 's songwriting contributions : `` I encouraged Richie to write songs .
I figured it would make him feel more a part of the group , because we never let anybody else write our songs .
`` Richie 's composition , `` Somebody Put Something in My Drink '' , remained a staple in the Ramones set list until their last show in 1996 and was included in the album Loud , Fast Ramones : Their Toughest Hits .
The eight song bonus disc , The Ramones Smash You : Live '85 , is also named after Richie 's composition `` Smash You '' .
The first album the Ramones recorded with Richie was Too Tough to Die in 1984 , with Tommy Erdelyi and Ed Stasium returning as producers .
The album marked a shift to something like the band 's original sound .
In the description of Allmusic 's Stephen Thomas Erlewine , the `` rhythms are back up to jackhammer speed and the songs are down to short , terse statements .
`` The band 's main release of 1985 was the British single `` Bonzo Goes to Bitburg '' ; though it was available in the United States only as an import , it was played widely on American college radio .
The song was written , primarily by Joey , in protest of Ronald Reagan 's visit to a German military cemetery , which included graves of Waffen SS soldiers .
Retitled `` My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down ( Bonzo Goes to Bitburg ) '' , the song appeared on the band 's ninth studio album , Animal Boy ( 1986 ) .
Produced by Jean Beauvoir , formerly a member of the Plasmatics , the album was characterized by a Rolling Stone reviewer as `` nonstop primal fuzz pop '' .
Making it his pick for `` album of the week '' , New York Times critic Jon Pareles wrote that the Ramones `` speak up for outcasts and disturbed individuals '' .
The following year the band recorded their last album with Richie , Halfway to Sanity .
Richie left in August 1987 , upset that after being in the band for five years , the other members would still not give him a share of the money they made selling T-shirts .
Richie was replaced by Clem Burke from Blondie , which was disbanded at the time .
According to Johnny , the performances with Burke—who adopted the name Elvis Ramone—were a disaster .
He was fired after two performances ( August 28 & 29 , 1987 ) because his drumming could not keep up with the rest of the band .
In September , Marky , now clean and sober , returned to the band .
In December 1988 , the Ramones recorded material for their eleventh studio album , Brain Drain ; co-produced by Beauvoir , Rey , and Bill Laswell .
However , the bass parts were done by Daniel Rey and the Dictators ' Andy Shernoff .
Dee Dee Ramone would only record the additional vocals on the album citing that the other members of the band ( including himself ) were going through personal troubles and changes to the point where he did n't want to be in the band anymore .
After the band finished their Halfway to Sanity tour in February 1989 , Dee Dee became sober and left the band .
He was replaced by Christopher Joseph Ward ( C.J .
Ramone ) , who performed with the band until they disbanded .
Dee Dee initially pursued a brief career as a rapper under the name Dee Dee King .
He quickly returned to punk rock and formed several bands , in much the same vein as the Ramones , for whom he also continued to write songs .
=== Final years : 1990–1996 === After more than a decade and a half at Sire Records , the Ramones moved to a new label , Radioactive Records .
Their first album for the label was 1992 's Mondo Bizarro , which reunited them with producer Ed Stasium .
Acid Eaters , consisting entirely of cover songs , came out the following year .
In 1993 , the Ramones were featured in the animated television series The Simpsons , providing music and voices for animated versions of themselves in the episode `` Rosebud '' .
Executive producer David Mirkin described the Ramones as `` gigantic , obsessive Simpsons fans .
`` In 1995 , the Ramones released ¡Adios Amigos ! , their fourteenth studio album , and announced that they planned to disband if it was not successful .
Its sales were unremarkable , garnering it just two weeks on the lower end of the Billboard chart .
The band spent late 1995 on what was promoted as a farewell tour .
However , they accepted an offer to appear in the sixth Lollapalooza festival , which toured around the United States during the following summer .
After the Lollapalooza tour 's conclusion , the Ramones played their final show on August 6 , 1996 , at the Palace in Hollywood .
A recording of the concert was later released on video and CD as We 're Outta Here ! .
In addition to a reappearance by Dee Dee , the show featured several guests including Motörhead 's Lemmy , Pearl Jam 's Eddie Vedder , Soundgarden 's Chris Cornell , Numskull 's Ralph Foster and Rancid 's Tim Armstrong and Lars Frederiksen .
=== Aftermath and deaths === On July 20 , 1999 , Dee Dee , Johnny , Joey , Tommy , Marky , and C.J .
appeared together at the Virgin Megastore in New York City for an autograph signing .
This was the last occasion on which the original four members of the group appeared together .
Joey , who had been diagnosed with lymphoma in 1995 , died of the illness on April 15 , 2001 , in New York .
Session drummer Billy Rogers , who performed on `` Time Has Come Today '' from Subterranean Jungle , died from complications due to pneumonia on August 7 , 2001 .
On March 18 , 2002 , the Ramones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , which specifically named Dee Dee , Johnny , Joey , Tommy , and Marky .
At the ceremony , the surviving inductees spoke on behalf of the band .
Johnny spoke first , thanking the band 's fans and blessing George W. Bush and his presidency .
Tommy spoke next , saying how honored the band felt , but how much it would have meant for Joey .
Dee Dee humorously congratulated and thanked himself , while Marky thanked Tommy for influencing his drum style .
Green Day played `` Teenage Lobotomy '' , `` Rockaway Beach '' , and `` Blitzkrieg Bop '' as a tribute , demonstrating the Ramones ' continuing influence on later rock musicians .
The ceremony was one of Dee Dee 's last public appearances ; on June 5 , 2002 , two months later , he was found at his Hollywood home , dead from a heroin overdose .
On November 30 , 2003 , New York City unveiled a sign designating East 2nd Street at the corner of Bowery as Joey Ramone Place .
The singer lived on East 2nd for a time , and the sign is near the former Bowery site of CBGB .
The documentary film End of the Century : The Story of the Ramones came out in 2004 .
Johnny , who had been privately suffering from prostate cancer , died on September 15 , 2004 in Los Angeles , shortly after the film 's release .
On the same day as Johnny 's death , the world 's first Ramones Museum opened its doors to the public .
Located in Berlin , Germany , the museum features more than 300 items of memorabilia , including a pair of stage-worn jeans from Johnny , a stage-worn glove from Joey , Marky 's sneakers , and C.J .
's stage-worn bass strap .
The Ramones were inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2007 .
That October saw the release of a DVD set containing concert footage of the band : It 's Alive 1974-1996 includes 118 songs from 33 performances over the span of the group 's career .
In February 2011 the group was honored with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award .
Drummers Tommy , Marky , and Richie attended the ceremony .
Marky declared , `` This is amazing .
I never expected this .
I 'm sure Johnny , Joey , and Dee Dee would never have expected this .
`` Richie noted that it was the first time ever that all three drummers were under the same roof , and mused that he could n't `` help thinking that [ Joey ] is watching us right now with a little smile on his face behind his rose-colored glasses .
`` On April 30 , 2014 , their first album , Ramones , became certified Gold by the Recording Industry of America after selling 500,000 copies , 38 years after its release .
Arturo Vega , creative director from their formation in 1974 until their disbanding in 1996 and often considered the fifth Ramone , died on June 8 , 2013 , at the age of 65 .
The final original member , Tommy Ramone , died on July 11 , 2014 after a battle with bile duct cancer .
On October 30 , 2016 , the RAMONES WAY was unveiled at the intersection of 67th Avenue and 110th Street in front of the main entrance of Forest Hills High School in the borough of Queens .
== Conflicts between members == There were strong tensions between Joey and Johnny , which colored much of the Ramones ' career .
The pair were politically antagonistic , Joey being a liberal and Johnny a conservative .
Their personalities also clashed : Johnny , who spent two years in military school , lived by a strict code of self-discipline , while Joey struggled with obsessive-compulsive disorder and alcoholism .
In the early 1980s , Linda Ramone began a relationship with Johnny after having already been romantically involved with Joey .
Consequently , despite their continued professional relationship , Joey and Johnny had become aloof .
It was not until after Joey 's death that Johnny had admitted to not calling Joey prior to his passing , and in the documentary End of the Century Johnny claimed that Joey 's death had a profound impact on him emotionally and that he was depressed for `` the whole week '' after his death .
Dee Dee 's bipolar disorder and repeated relapses into drug addiction also caused significant strains .
Tommy would also leave the band after being `` physically threatened by Johnny , treated with contempt by Dee Dee , and all but ignored by Joey '' .
As new members joined over the years , disbursement and the bands ' image frequently became matters of serious dispute .
The tensions among the group members were not kept secret from the public as was heard on the Howard Stern radio show in 1997 , where during the interview Marky and Joey got into a fight about their respective drinking habits .
== Style == === Musical style === The Ramones ' loud , fast , straightforward musical style was influenced by pop music that the band members grew up listening to in the 1950s and 1960s , including classic rock groups such as the Beach Boys , the Who , the Beatles , the Kinks , Led Zeppelin , the Rolling Stones and Creedence Clearwater Revival ; bubblegum acts like the 1910 Fruitgum Company and Ohio Express ; and girl groups such as the Ronettes and the Shangri-Las .
They also drew on the harder rock sound of the MC5 , Black Sabbath , the Stooges and the New York Dolls , now known as seminal protopunk bands .
The Ramones ' style was in part a reaction against the heavily produced , often bombastic music that dominated the pop charts in the 1970s .
`` We decided to start our own group because we were bored with everything we heard , '' Joey once explained .
`` In 1974 everything was tenth-generation Elton John , or overproduced , or just junk .
Everything was long jams , long guitar solos ... .
We missed music like it used to be .
`` Ira Robbins and Scott Isler of Trouser Press describe the result : With just four chords and one manic tempo , New York 's Ramones blasted open the clogged arteries of mid-'70s rock , reanimating the music .
Their genius was to recapture the short/simple aesthetic from which pop had strayed , adding a caustic sense of trash-culture humor and minimalist rhythm guitar sound .
As leaders in the punk rock scene , the Ramones ' music has usually been identified with that label , while some have defined their characteristic style more specifically as pop punk and others as power pop .
In the 1980s , the band sometimes veered into hardcore punk territory , as can be heard on Too Tough to Die .
On stage , the band adopted a focused approach directly intended to increase the audience 's concert experience .
Johnny 's instructions to C.J .
when preparing for his first live performances with the group were to play facing the audience , to stand with the bass slung low between spread legs , and to walk forward to the front of stage at the same time as he did .
Johnny was not a fan of guitarists who performed facing their drummer , amplifier , or other band members .
=== Visual imagery === The Ramones ' art and visual imagery complemented the themes of their music and performance .
The band members adopted a uniform look of long hair , leather jackets , T-shirts , torn jeans , and sneakers .
This fashion emphasized minimalism , which was a powerful influence on the New York punk scene of the 1970s and reflected the band 's short , simple songs .
Tommy Ramone recalled that , both musically and visually , `` we were influenced by comic books , movies , the Andy Warhol scene , and avant-garde films .
I was a big Mad magazine fan myself .
`` The band 's logo was created by New York City artist Arturo Vega together with the Ramones .
Vega was a longtime friend who had allowed Joey and Dee Dee to move into his loft .
Vega produced the band 's T-shirts , their main source of income , basing most of the images on a black-and-white self-portrait photograph he had taken of his American bald eagle belt buckle which had appeared on the back sleeve of the Ramones ' first album .
He was inspired to create the band 's logo after a trip to Washington , D.C. : I saw them as the ultimate all-American band .
To me , they reflected the American character in general—an almost childish innocent aggression ... .
I thought , 'The Great Seal of the President of the United States ' would be perfect for the Ramones , with the eagle holding arrows—to symbolize strength and the aggression that would be used against whomever dares to attack us—and an olive branch , offered to those who want to be friendly .
But we decided to change it a little bit .
Instead of the olive branch , we had an apple tree branch , since the Ramones were American as apple pie .
And since Johnny was such a baseball fanatic , we had the eagle hold a baseball bat instead of the [ Great Seal ] 's arrows .
The scroll in the eagle 's beak originally read `` Look out below '' , but this was soon changed to `` Hey ho let 's go '' after the opening lyrics of the band 's first single , `` Blitzkrieg Bop '' .
The arrowheads on the shield came from a design on a polyester shirt Vega had bought .
The name `` Ramones '' was spelled out in block capitals above the logo using plastic stick-on letters .
Where the presidential emblem read `` Seal of the President of the United States '' clockwise in the border around the eagle , Vega instead placed the pseudonyms of the four band members : Johnny , Joey , Dee Dee , and Tommy .
Over the years the names in the border would change as the band 's line-up fluctuated .
== Influence == The Ramones had a broad and lasting influence on the development of popular music .
Music historian Jon Savage writes of their debut album that `` it remains one of the few records that changed pop forever .
`` As described by AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine , `` The band 's first four albums set the blueprint for punk , especially American punk and hardcore , for the next two decades .
`` Trouser Press 's Robbins and Isler similarly wrote that the Ramones `` not only spearheaded the original new wave/punk movement , but also drew the blueprint for subsequent hardcore punk bands '' .
Punk journalist Phil Strongman writes , `` In purely musical terms , the Ramones , in attempting to re-create the excitement of pre-Dolby rock , were to cast a huge shadow—they had fused a blueprint for much of the indie future .
`` Writing for Slate in 2001 , Douglas Wolk described the Ramones as `` easily the most influential group of the last 30 years .
`` The Ramones ' debut album had an outsized effect relative to its modest sales .
According to Generation X bassist Tony James , `` Everybody went up three gears the day they got that first Ramones album .
Punk rock—that rama-lama super fast stuff—is totally down to the Ramones .
Bands were just playing in an MC5 groove until then .
`` The Ramones ' two July 1976 shows , like their debut album , are seen as having a significant impact on the style of many of the newly formed British punk acts—as one observer put it , `` instantly nearly every band speeded up '' .
The Ramones ' first British concert , at London 's Roundhouse concert hall , was held on July 4 , 1976 , the United States Bicentennial .
The Sex Pistols were playing in Sheffield that evening , supported by the Clash , making their public debut .
The next night , members of both bands attended the Ramones ' gig at the Dingwall 's club .
Ramones manager Danny Fields recalls a conversation between Johnny Ramone and Clash bassist Paul Simonon ( which he mislocates at the Roundhouse ) : `` Johnny asked him , 'What do you do ?
Are you in a band ?
' Paul said , 'Well , we just rehearse .
We call ourselves the Clash but we 're not good enough .
' Johnny said , 'Wait till you see us—we stink , we 're lousy , we ca n't play .
Just get out there and do it .
' '' Another band whose members saw the Ramones perform , the Damned , played their first show two days later .
The central fanzine of the early UK punk scene , Sniffin ' Glue , was named after the song `` Now I Wan na Sniff Some Glue '' , which appeared on the debut LP .
Ramones concerts and recordings influenced many musicians central to the development of California punk as well , including Greg Ginn of Black Flag , Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys , Al Jourgensen of Ministry , Mike Ness of Social Distortion , Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion , and members of the Descendents .
Canada 's first major punk scenes—in Toronto and in British Columbia 's Victoria and Vancouver—were also heavily influenced by the Ramones .
In the late 1970s , many bands emerged with musical styles deeply indebted to the band 's .
There were the Lurkers from England , the Undertones from Ireland , Teenage Head from Canada , and the Zeros and the Dickies from southern California .
The seminal hardcore band Bad Brains took its name from a Ramones song .
The Riverdales emulated the sound of the Ramones throughout their career .
Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong named his son Joey in homage to Joey Ramone , and drummer Tré Cool named his daughter Ramona .
New Jersey 's horror punk/hardcore punk band the Misfits ( whose bassist Jerry Only was a longtime friend of the band ) were influenced by the `` Blitzkrieg '' tempo of the Ramones , infusing it into their already medium-fast tempo , R & B style of punk rock .
The Ramones also influenced musicians associated with other genres , such as heavy metal .
Their influence on metal gave birth to the punk-metal `` fusion '' genre of thrash .
Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett , one of the originators of thrash guitar , has described the importance of Johnny 's rapid-fire guitar playing style to his own musical development .
Motörhead lead singer Lemmy , a friend of the Ramones since the late 1970s , mixed the band 's `` Go Home Ann '' in 1985 .
The members of Motörhead later composed the song `` R.A.M.O.N.E.S .
`` as a tribute , and Lemmy performed at the final Ramones concert in 1996 .
In the realm of alternative rock , the song `` 53rd and 3rd '' lent its name to a British indie pop label cofounded by Stephen Pastel of the Scottish band the Pastels .
Evan Dando of the Lemonheads , Dave Grohl of Nirvana and Foo Fighters , Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater , Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam ( who introduced the band members at their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ) and the Strokes are among the many alternative rock and metal musicians who have credited the Ramones with inspiring them .
The band members were also individually influential .
Johnny Ramone was named one of Time 's `` 10 Greatest Electric-Guitar Players '' in 2003 .
That same year , he was number 16 on the `` 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time '' list in Rolling Stone .
`` We think of the Ramones as a classic , iconic band , '' observed Gene Simmons .
`` They have one gold record to their name .
They never played arenas ; could n't sell them out .
It was a failed band .
It does n't mean they were n't great .
It means the masses did n't care .
`` Kevin Morby 's fourth album City Music features the track `` 1234 '' inspired by the singer 's childhood love of Ramones .
It features the lyrics `` Joey , Johnny , Dee Dee , Tommy/ They were all my friends , but they died .
`` === Tribute albums === In April 2009 , Spin writer Mark Prindle observed that the Ramones had to date `` inspired a jaw-dropping 48 ( at least !
) full-length tribute records .
`` The first Ramones tribute album featuring multiple performers was released in 1991 : Gabba Gabba Hey : A Tribute to the Ramones includes tracks by such acts as the Flesh Eaters , L7 , Mojo Nixon , and Bad Religion .
In 2001 , Dee Dee made a guest appearance on one track of Ramones Maniacs , a multi-artist cover of the entire Ramones Mania compilation album .
The Song Ramones the Same , which came out the following year , includes performances by the Dictators , who were part of the early New York punk scene , and Wayne Kramer , guitarist for the influential protopunk band MC5 .
We 're a Happy Family : A Tribute to Ramones , released in 2003 , features performers such as Rancid , Green Day , Metallica , Kiss , the Offspring , Red Hot Chili Peppers , U2 , and Rob Zombie ( who also did the album cover artwork ) .
Also some other famous bands recorded tribute songs .
Motörhead 's Phil Campbell tells in Jari-Pekka Laitio-Ramone 's book Ramones : Soundtrack Of Our Lives : `` We did a cover of Rockaway Beach with me on backing vocals , which was quite enjoyable .
When Johnny Ramone heard it , he refused to put it on the tribute album .
Lemmy and I thought we did a good version .
`` Punk bands such as Screeching Weasel , the Vindictives , the Queers , Parasites , the Mr. T Experience , Boris the Sprinkler , Beatnik Termites , Tip Toppers , Jon Cougar Concentration Camp , McRackins , and Kobanes have recorded cover versions of entire Ramones albums—Ramones , Leave Home , Rocket to Russia , It 's Alive , Road to Ruin , End of the Century , Pleasant Dreams , Subterranean Jungle , two versions of Too Tough to Die , and Halfway To Sanity respectively .
The Huntingtons ' File Under Ramones consists of Ramones covers from across the band 's history .
Shonen Knife , an all-woman trio band from Osaka , Japan , was formed in 1981 as a direct result of founder-lead singer-guitarist Naoko Yamano 's instant infatuation with the music of the Ramones .
In 2012 , to observe the band 's 30th anniversary , Shonen Knife released Osaka Ramones , which featured thirteen Ramones songs covered by the band .
There are also many other tribute albums listed on Jari-Pekka Laitio-Ramone 's site .

The Idlers of the United States Coast Guard Academy ( USCGA ) are an all-male collegiate a cappella ensemble specializing in the performance of sea shanties and patriotic music .
== Overview == A relatively exclusive group with a history and traditions similar to many fraternal organizations , the Idlers are the only all-male a cappella vocal group at the U. S. Coast Guard Academy .
Membership is attained through annual auditions overseen by the current members and the director .
Group size varies based on current requirements , but generally includes between 12 and 20 men .
The ideal group includes 3 or 4 members for each part : Tenor 1 , Tenor 2 , Baritone , and Bass .
The group began in 1957 with 14 singers , two of which were freshman ( 4/c cadets ) .
The Idlers have an elected President , who historically was the `` pitch '' and leads rehearsals in the absence of the director .
The Vice President was the `` vice-pitch '' , also an elected position .
== History == === Founding === The Idlers were formed in 1957 by eight members of the USCGA Class of 1959 on summer cruise .
They quickly drew the attention of the Academy 's bandmaster Don Janse and began building their repertoire and fame .
In the fall of 1957 , the Idlers membership was extended to all Academy classes , as reflected in this photo , taken several months thereafter .
Within two years the Idlers had recorded three vinyl albums ( for both the Design and MGM labels ) , and had performed for President and Mrs. Eisenhower at the White House and on The Bell Telephone Hour ( NBC ) .
=== 1960s === Don Janse went back to school in the early 1960s and John Heffermann briefly directed the Idlers .
When Don returned he brought a number of new tunes which would soon become Idlers staples , including arrangements of Banua , The First Time I Ever , and the Coast Guard Hymn .
=== 1970s === The 1970s saw a resurgence of interest in folk music .
Patterned after The Kingston Trio , a splinter group known as The New London Trio performed with guitar , upright bass , and banjo .
The Idlers sang at the re-interment of Captain Hopley Yeaton , the father of the Coast Guard , on October 19 , 1975 .
The Singing Idlers made an appearance on Saturday Night Live on February 28 , 1976 , where Leon Redbone was the musical guest , and the hostess Jill Clayburgh sang `` Sea Cruise '' backed by the group .
During the Academy centennial in 1976 , several reunion attendees and other Idlers living nearby performed at a black tie dinner held at the Norwich Sheraton - arguably the first reunion of past and present members on the same stage .
In January 1977 the Idlers performed at the Smithsonian Air & Space Museum and the American History Museum associated with the Presidential Inauguration of Jimmy Carter .
=== 1980s === In both 1980 and 1982 , The Idlers performed at Carnegie Hall during Eve Queler 's performance of Wagner 's Rienzi opera .
In 1984 , the Idlers and Icebreakers appeared on a sailing ship float with a Statue of Liberty head ( and Robert Vaughn ) in the Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade .
The 1980s drew to a close with Don Janse 's retirement in 1987 .
Dr. Robert Newton had been conducting the Idlers sister group , The Icebreakers , and now began directing both groups .
Dr. Newton took the Idlers on their first annual tour of Florida in 1989 , performing for Magic Music Days at Walt Disney World , and at the Palm Beach International Polo Club , accompanied on the keyboard by then LTjg Mark Dietrich , I'86 .
The Idlers performed at three Balls during President George H. W. Bush 's Inauguration in 1989 .
=== 1990s === In 1990 , The Idlers supported the Coast Guard 's Bicentennial celebration with performances at the Senior Bowl in Mobile , AL , and the military tribute ball in Dallas , TX .
With the start of the Gulf War , The Idlers supported dozens of USO functions throughout the country , with notable performances in and around New York City , at Ellis Island , and at Fisher 's Island in Miami , FL .
The Idlers were in such great demand that several quartets were formed , featuring one vocalist for each of the 4 parts .
Singing Valentines , intimate dinner parties , accent performances for Flag Dinners - nothing was too small for an Idlers Quartet .
The Idlers marched in the November 22 , 1990 Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade with Miss America 1991 , Marjorie Vincent .
The group performed throughout Washington D.C. during President William J. Clinton 's Inauguration in 1993 .
The group sang aboard the Aircraft Carrier USS Intrepid as part of the October 24 , 1995 tribute to slain leader Yitzhak Rabin .
40th Year Reunion 1998 saw the first stand-alone reunion of The Idlers .
Conceived and executed by Edward `` Cherry '' Beale , I'92 , the reunion spanned an entire weekend in April .
An opening dinner was hosted at The Griswold Inn in Essex , Connecticut on Friday night .
Some remarked that this was the retirement dinner Don Janse never got .
Saturday was filled with rehearsals for the reunion concert in Leamy Hall .
The audience was full , and the show was opened by Forebitter of Mystic Seaport .
Performances by the current Idlers , quartets , and Trios filled the middle of the program .
John Heffermann , then Don Janse took turns conducting the combined 50-voice ensemble .
Bob Newton finished the program , then handed out awards and recognition .
=== 2000s === The group traveled to New Orleans for a November 9 , 2001 USO concert .
The Idlers performed from the Parade of Roses ' Abe Lincoln float on New Year 's Day , 2004 .
The city of Fort Worth , Texas declared January 13 , 2006 to be USCG Academy day in honor of a performance by The Idlers.- Members of the group performed a patriotic salute and the National Anthem in Browns Stadium to a sold out crowd on September 9 , 2007 .
50th Year Reunion The 50th year reunion was held April 18 , 2008 at the Griswold Inn , and April 19 , 2008 at the Coast Guard Academy .
Thirty nine men returned to pay tribute to the 50 classes of graduates , and five decades of spreading goodwill through song .
=== 2010s === The Idlers started their 6th full decade with a week-long tour of Italy in March 2010 .
A recording from a cathedral in Italy served as the basis for their latest CD .
In 2011 and 2012 , the group completed spring break tours of Florida , with numerous public appearances including Disney World .
== Music == === General === The Idlers memorize all their music .
The repertoire varies from year to year but typically is heavy on Sea Chanteys and patriotic tunes .
The occasional show tune and holiday song round out the mix .
The Sea Chanty list is weighted towards capstan songs .
Several numbers feature soloists , but a principal concern of all Idlers is the ability to blend well .
No individual voice stands out , as they work together to create a smooth and pleasing harmony .
=== Repertoire === Core numbers Banua Eternal Father Alma Mater Mingulay Boat Song The Rattlin ' Bog The Armed Forces Medley Regular favorites 10,000 Miles Away The Idlers Song South Australia High Barbaree A Whale of a Tale Drunken Sailor Eddystone Light The Wild Rover === Discography === ( incomplete , reference ) Sing Along with The Idlers , 1960 , Pickwick Americana , 1960 , Pickwick Blow Ye Winds ( with CGA Singers ) , 1960 , MGM Songs of Action ( with CGA Singers ) , 1965 ? , MGM Good Times Are Not Over , 1968 , CGA Songs of Seas and Waterways ( with CGA Singers ) , 1976 , CGA A Seabag of Songs ( with CGA Singers ) , 1977 , CGA Cadet Music ( with Icebreakers ) , 1993 , CGA Cadet Music ( with Icebreakers ) , 1997 , CGA USCGA Cadet Glee Glub ( with Icebreakers ) , 2004 , CGA Ten Thousand Miles Away , 2006 , CGA === Instruments === Some performances are augmented by various instruments .

Americana is an amalgam of American folk music formed by the confluence of the shared and varied traditions that make up the musical ethos of the United States ; specifically those sounds that are merged from folk , country , blues , rhythm and blues , rock and roll and other external influences .
Americana , as defined by the Americana Music Association ( AMA ) , is `` contemporary music that incorporates elements of various American roots music styles , including country , roots-rock , folk , bluegrass , R & B and blues , resulting in a distinctive roots-oriented sound that lives in a world apart from the pure forms of the genres upon which it may draw .
While acoustic instruments are often present and vital , Americana also often uses a full electric band .
`` == Americana as a radio format == Americana as a radio format developed during the 1990s as a reaction to the highly polished sound that defined the mainstream music of that decade ( similar pressures also led to the formation of the classic country format at around the same time ) .
Because of listener interest in the artists who do not fit as comfortably in the country or rock genres , a radio format called `` Americana '' was developed by the AMA and reported by R & R ( Radio & Records , a radio trade publication ) .
Born out of Triple A , non-commercial , country and other formats , the Americana format is the sum of the parts that have showcased Americana music since its inception .
The AMA grew out of the format as an effort to bring all Americana music supporters , performers , and professionals together to expand the visibility and viability of the music .
The radio format , including the term `` Americana , '' began in early 1995 through the efforts of Rob Bleetstein of San Francisco , and Jon Grimson of Nashville .
Bleetstein became the first Americana chart editor as Gavin magazine ( a former radio trade publication ) created the first Americana radio chart , which was published on January 20 , 1995 .
This came about when KFAT radio in Gilroy , California went off the air , and Bleetstein went to the Gavin Report , asserting that they were missing a category of music .
He described the KFAT format , which had the widest playlist of any station in the country , and most of whose artists whose music would come to be known as Americana .
Bleetstein worked closely with KFAN `` Texas Rebel Radio '' in Texas and KPIG , KFAT 's descendant , in California in developing the Americana format .
Both stations had been on the air with their own versions of an independent format for several years and had been instrumental in the development of the AAA format as well .
The publisher agreed and gave Bleetstein the job of creating and running the chart .
Grimson coined the term Americana and became the first Americana radio promoter after having promoted the music previously at Warner Brothers Records Nashville , and promoting those releases that WB worked to radio formats outside the mainstream country stations .
The AMA was later established to expand the musical format outside of strictly radio , but still including the radio aspect as well .

Anus is the debut studio album by American drag performer Alaska Thunderfuck ( aka Justin Honard ) .
It was released on June 23 , 2015 , through Sidecar Records .
Musically , the album is an compilation of pop and dance music with electronic elements ; it features appearances from three of Alaska 's fellow RuPaul 's Drag Race contestants : season four 's Willam , and season six 's Courtney Act and Laganja Estranja .
Alaska released her second album studio Poundcake in 2016 right after the finale of the second season of Rupaul 's Drag Race : All Stars .
== Background == In November 2012 , Honard was announced as one of the fourteen drag queens who would be competing on the fifth season of reality competition RuPaul 's Drag Race , but would be known by the mononym Alaska , with the last name Thunderfuck omitted .
During the show , Honard provided lyrics for a charity single , `` Can I Get An Amen ?
`` Shortly after filming RuPaul 's Drag Race , Thunderfuck penned her first songs .
The first , titled `` Ru Girl '' , was released in December 2013 , although it ultimately did not make the cut for Anus .
Thunderfuck also wrote `` Nails '' , which eventually was released as the second single from the album .
Concerning the album 's title , Thunderfuck stated “It was the only thing I could call it .
There’s nothing else .
There’s simply no other title.” == Music and lyrics == All songs on the album are issued with the explicit tag , indicating swearing , except the piano introduction to `` Nails '' .
The album 's opening track , `` Hieeee '' , incorporates one of Honard 's signature catchphrases , the elongated pronunciation of the word Hi .
Honard summed the song up as `` drag 101 '' , stating that it utilized many drag queen sayings normally used in bar and club culture , including phrases such as `` the more you drink , the prettier we look .
`` Honard cited the buildup compiled of Laganja Estranja quotes as his favorite part of the song .
The sixth and seventh tracks on the album , `` Nails ( Piano Introduction ) '' and `` Nails '' , run concurrently in the songs ' music video , but are split for the release of the album .
`` Nails '' was one of the earliest tracks penned for Anus , written shortly after filming for RuPaul 's Drag Race had concluded .
The song was inspired by Honard 's newfound love for artificial nails , and the feeling they give him when wearing them .
Honard described `` Nails ( Piano Introduction ) '' as `` show tunes-y '' .
Honard cites `` cat scratch fever , look like Sigourney Weaver , are you June Cleaver or a Labrador Retriever ?
`` as his favorite line from the track .
The song `` This Is My Hair '' , was originally a deep , politically-driven song discussing the economy and teenage prostitution ; however , the production company did not like the original version and requested Honard re-write it .
Upon re-listening to the beat , he was inspired by the offensive remark of somebody telling a drag queen that they love their wig , as opposed to them loving their hair .
Honard revealed the reason he sang with a Croatian accent was because he had just finished performing there .
He cites `` I take my vitamins '' as one of his favorite lyrics from the song .
== Singles == On June 10 , 2014 , `` Your Makeup Is Terrible '' was released as the first single from Anus .
Pitchfork Media named the song as the best song ever by a RuPaul 's Drag Race contestant .
The video for `` Your Makeup Is Terrible '' was released on June 9 , 2014 , and was directed by Saša Numić .
On December 9 , 2014 , `` Nails '' was released as the second single from the album .
Nails was also supported by the promotional separate release of the song 's music video introduction , released on the same day as the main single .
Honard described the video in his Let the Music Play episode : `` The video 's really cool , and it starts out with the piano introduction , which is like , really sweet and like , show tunes-y .
It 's like , really sweet and serene and she 's in outer space , and then , the spaceship crashes .
She gets abducted by an evil , nefarious , secret-agent-type man , who then takes her to an interrogation room and is like , ripping off her nails , with like , pliers '' .
On June 9 , 2015 , `` Hieeee '' was released as the third single from Anus .
`` Hieeee '' charted at number five on the US Billboard Comedy Digital Tracks chart , becoming Honard 's second appearance on a Billboard chart ( the first being `` American Apparel Ad Girls '' with Courtney Act and Willam , which peaked at number ten on the same chart ) .
`` Hieeee '' was noted as being the `` best of the worst '' songs by RuPaul 's Drag Race contestants by Pitchfork Media .
Two videos were released to promote the single , both released on June 8 , 2015 .
One video was dubbed the `` official '' video , and was filmed in Fort Lauderdale , Florida , on the closing night of the Battle of the Seasons tour .
The other video was titled the `` unofficial '' video , and featured Honard showcasing gifts he had received from fans during his career .
On June 23 , 2015 , the same day as the album 's release , `` This Is My Hair '' was released as Anus 's fourth single .
In an interview with NOISEY , Honard stated that he plans to shoot music videos for the tracks `` Anus '' , “The Shade of It All” , `` Pussy '' , and `` Gim me All Your Money '' .
== Release and promotion == The artwork and track listing for Anus was released on June 9 , 2015 .
The album received a worldwide released on June 23 , 2015 , via digital distributors .
The CD version of the album was released on July 21 , 2015 , while an LP version was released on November 13 , 2015 .
Similarly to how Sharon Needles and Adore Delano promoted their albums PG-13 and Till Death Do Us Party , Honard released a series of videos through the YouTube channel of World of Wonder , titled Let The Music Play .
During these videos , Honard would choose a different song each episode , and discuss the songs background , content and meaning in detail .
The premiere episode focused on the then-recently released single `` This Is My Hair '' .
The song `` Everything Tonight '' was featured as background music in a segment of Today .
== Critical reception == Anus received highly positive reviews from critics .
In his review for NOISEY , John Hill simply stated , `` Anus is a really fucking good album. '' .
In his list of `` The Best and Worst Music of RuPaul 's Drag Divas '' for Pitchfork Media , Andy Emitt praised `` Your Makeup Is Terrible '' and `` Hieee '' , writing that `` If any 'Drag Race ' diva rivals the immaculate confection of `` Supermodel ( You Better Work ) '' , it is Alaska Thunderfuck with 'Your Makeup Is Terrible ' .
In her indescribable voice , Alaska satirizes the dance genre’s formulaic predictability on the song’s bridge , narrating its rhythmic shift as if surprised herself , '' later noting `` the RuPaulian tradition in Alaska’s ability to bridge the song’s queer , camp elements with pop music aspirations through a club-ready beat .
`` Emitt went on to list `` Hieee '' as one of the `` fabulously worst '' tracks from Drag Race Divas : `` ... the song sounds like the catchphrase-ready queen running out of new material live on the studio mic .
Apparently , this isn’t a problem—the track thumps the hollow but always captivating reservoir of Thunderfuck tonality and delivery ...
When drag divas produce garbage , at least we’re laughing with them .
`` Matthew Carenza for The Magic Critique gave the album four out of five stars , commenting that `` Alaska 's creative genius has continually been growing over the years , and her new album is a testament to that .
`` Carenza went on to say that the album is `` so incredibly different than any of the other queens ' albums , and it 's one hundred percent authentically Alaska .
It 's a labor of love for Alaska and everyone should grab a copy and support this queen because she 's simply beyond .
`` Luis Gonzalez for Album Confessions awarded the album four out of five stars , commenting that `` staying true to her devoted fan base and her drag aesthetic allows Alaska to go above and beyond musical expectations .
While it 's nice to hear that the performer has not lost her comedic chops or her likable and one-of-a-kind personality , the album easily maneuvers around serious subject matter and topics buried deep within the Drag Bible .
`` == Commercial performance == Upon release , Anus topped the iTunes Dance albums chart .
For the week of July 11 , 2015 , Anus appeared on three Billboard charts : number four on the Heatseekers , an extension to the Billboard 200 ; number three on the Dance/Electronic Albums ; and number fourteen on the Independent Albums chart .
In comparison to other RuPaul 's Drag Race alumni , Anus was a commercial success , peaking higher than projects from fellow contestants Willam , Miss Fame , and Violet Chachki .

A devotional song is a hymn which accompanies religious observances and rituals .
Traditionally devotional music has been a part of Christian music , Hindu music , Sufi music , Buddhist music , Islamic music and Jewish music Each major religion has its own tradition with devotional hymns .
In the West , the devotional has been a part of the liturgy in Roman Catholicism , the Greek Orthodox Church , the Russian Orthodox Church , and others , since their earliest days .
A devotional is a part of the prayer service proper and is not , in these contexts , ornamentation .
During the Protestant Reformation , church music in general was hotly debated .
Some Puritans objected to all ornament and sought to abolish choirs , hymns , and , inasmuch as liturgy itself was rejected , devotionals .
In Eastern and Near-Eastern religions , devotionals can function as communion prayer and meditation .
These are sung in particular rhythms which are sustained over a prolonged period to give practitioners a mystical experience .
In Hindu music , the genre arising out of the Bhakti movement ( devotion ) , it takes forms like Bhajan , Kirtan and Aarti .
== Kinds of devotional music == Bhajan : a Hindu or Sikh devotional .
Borgeet : an Assamese devotional .
Qawwali : the devotional music of the Sufis , a mystical tradition of Islam .

Ian Geoffrey Levine ( born 22 June 1953 ) , is an English songwriter , producer , and DJ .
A noted moderniser of Northern soul music in the UK , and a developer of the style of Hi-NRG , he has written and produced records with sales totalling over 40 million .
Levine is also a noted fan of the long-running television show Doctor Who .
== Early and personal life == Born into a Jewish family , his parents owned and ran the `` Lemon Tree '' complex in Blackpool , including its casino and nightclub .
Levine is openly gay .
He suffered a major stroke in July 2014 , leaving him with severely limited movement on the left side of his body .
== Career == === Disc jockey === Levine began collecting Motown records from the age of 13 , building a collection sourced from both UK record shops and those that his visited on family holidays to Miami and New Orleans .
This later extended to him becoming an avid collector of soul , R & B , and Northern soul .
After his parents emigrated to the Caribbean in 1979 , Levine sold the bulk of his record collection to fund the purchase of a home in London .
Having attended some of the early Northern soul all-nighters at `` The Twisted Wheel '' nightclub in Manchester with DJ Stuart Bremner , on leaving school in 1971 he became a disc jockey at the Blackpool Mecca .
Levine joined other DJ 's in travelling to Stoke on Trent to join the Northern soul all-nighter `` Torch '' , which was quickly shut down but was the fore runner of the Wigan Casino events , which Levine opened .
Working with fellow DJ Colin Curtis , the pair was responsible for guiding the Northern Soul scene away from its oldies-only policy and towards modern soul and disco .
This resulted in BBC Radio 1 's DJ John Peel travelling to Blackpool to interview Levine .
In 1979 , Levine began advising London 's gay disco Heaven on its set-up .
He subsequently became the club 's first resident DJ , remaining through most of the 1980s .
=== Writer/producer === In 1974 Levine compiled his first album `` Solid Soul Sensations '' , which released on Pye Records got to No .
11 in the UK Albums Charts , gaining a silver disc .
With the proceeds he travelled to New York City and co-produced Reaching For The Best with girl band The Exciters , which reached No.31 on the UK Singles Charts selling 80,000 records .
This allowed Levine to then travel to Chicago , where he signed postman L.J .
Johnson , Barbara Pennington ( who both after appearing on Top of the Pops reached the UK Singles Charts ) , as well as Evelyn Thomas .
Although Thomas 's 1976 record Weak Spot was not a big success reaching No .
26 in the UK , Levine 's later 1984 produced record High Energy sold seven million copies .
=== Hi-NRG === In 1983 , the London-based record shop Record Shack offered Levine £2,000 to set up a new joint-veture record label , Record Shack Records .
Through friend Jean-Philippe Iliesco he used his Trident Studios , and formed a songwriting partnership with Fiachra Trench .
The first record from the label was So Many Men , So Little Time by Miquel Brown ( step-sister of Amii Stewart and Sinitta 's mother ) , which sold two million copies and topped the American Billboard charts .
This was quickly followed by High Energy by Evelyn Thomas .
The partnership with Record Shack ended in 1985 , but by that time the label had sold 12 million records .
Afterward his return to the UK following the financial failure of Motorcity Records , Levine wrote and produced Hi-NRG-derived singles for various bands , including Take That ( he produced their first three singles ) , and The Pasadenas .
During the 1980s and 1990s he co-wrote and mixed a number of dance-pop hits for a variety of artists , including : Pet Shop Boys ; Erasure ; Kim Wilde ; Bronski Beat ; Amanda Lear ; Bananarama ; Tiffany ; Dollar ; and Hazell Dean .
He has also latterly written and produced several TV themes including `` Discomania '' , `` Gypsy Girl '' , `` ITV Celebrity Awards Show '' , `` Christmasmania '' and `` Abbamania '' .
=== Manager === Levine founded bands , including : Seventh Avenue , which featured two members of Big Fun ; Optimystic ; and Bad Boys Inc. During this period , Levine also maintained a friendship and rivalry with Simon Cowell .
In 2010 Levine formed a new boy band called `` Inju5tice '' .
After the commercial failure of debut `` A Long Long Way From Home '' the band and Levine split , and the band relaunched itself as ELi'Prime .
=== Record labels === In 1987 , Levine began recording some former artists from Motown .
After a reunion of 60 Motown stars , including Edwin Starr and Levi Stubbs on top of a hotel opposite the original Hitsville USA building , Motorcity Records was launched as a record label .
Initially distributed by PRT , then Pacific , Charly and finally Total/BMG , by the time that the label ended in the 1990s due to severe financial losses , 850 songs had been recorded by 108 artists .
== Doctor Who == Levine is well known as a fan of the BBC science fiction television series Doctor Who .
Levine was , in part , responsible for the return of a number of missing episodes of the show to the BBC 's archives .
He also retained many off-air recordings .
Levine was consulted by members of the production team about continuity for a while during the mid-1980s .
In 1985 , when the BBC announced that the series would be placed on an eighteen-month hiatus , and the show 's cancellation was widely rumoured , Levine was heavily involved with the media protest covertly organised by series producer John Nathan-Turner .
He appeared on the ITN 's News at One arguing against the decision , and together with the series ' production manager Gary Downie gathered a group of actors from the series to record Doctor in Distress .
The single was universally panned .
Levine also financed a private project to recreate the incomplete 1979 Doctor Who story Shada with animation and newly recorded dialogue from many surviving cast members .
Levine had hoped that the project would be released on DVD , but the commissioning editor of the Doctor Who DVD range did not use Levine 's animation on the DVD release of the story .
The completed Levine version appeared on torrent sites almost two years later , on 12 October 2013 .
Levine has been responsible for producing a number of extras on the Doctor Who DVD releases : the documentaries `` Over the Edge '' and `` Inside the Spaceship '' were included on the 3-disc set `` The Beginning '' , while `` Genesis of a Classic '' appeared on the release for Genesis of the Daleks .
He also composed the theme music for K-9 and Company , an unsuccessful pilot for a proposed Doctor Who spin-off series featuring the robotic dog and Sarah Jane Smith .
== American comic books == Levine claims to have the only complete set of DC Comics in the world , with at least one copy of each DC comic book sold at retail from the 1930s to present .
The writer and comic book expert Paul Sassienie began cataloging , grading and certificating 'The Ian Levine ' collection in May 2011 .

Martial industrial a subgenre of syncretic post-industrial music characterized by industrial noises , dark ambient atmospheres , neofolk melodies , dark wave tunes and neoclassical orchestrations as well as the incorporation of audio from military marches , historical speeches and political , apolitical or metapolitical lyrics .
Unlike other post-industrial genres , martial industrial is typically interested more in a particular worldview or philosophy than pure experimentalism .
== History == Laibach were one of the first bands to incorporate military marches in their industrial music and display politically provocative aesthetics .
Boyd Rice and Douglas P. , the noise and neofolk pioneers , respectively , adopted such attitude at several occasions to its extreme .
Allerseelen , either through ritual hymns or alchemical folklore followed in the same vein .
Similarly militant but less provocative and more esoteric were the heroic choral outputs of ACTUS .
Les Joyaux de la Princesse developed the genre further , offering a particularly mesmerizing style of dark ambient intermingled with historical samples , speeches and interbellum chansons .
The Moon Lay Hidden Beneath a Cloud / Der Blutharsch enriched this tradition , adding darkwave medieval melodies to the mix .
Finally , In Slaughter Natives and Puissance expanded the genre towards orchestral and neoclassical paths , respectively .
== Characteristics == The term 'Martial ' does not necessarily refer only to military drumming but in general to ominous/dramatic atmospheres and a particular thematology , style , aesthetics and Weltanschauung .
Similarly , the term 'industrial ' does not denote only old-school industrial music , but rather the broad spectrum of post-industrial scene ( from neofolk acoustics to harsh noise ) .
Thus , sonically diverse bands like Genocide Organ ( power electronics ) , Oda Relicta ( sacral ) , Stahlwerk 9 ( industrial ) , N.K.V.D .
( industrial black metal ) , Die Weisse Rose ( darkwave ) , Axon Neuron/Vagwa ( dark ambient ) , Feindflug ( EBM ) , Gae Bolg and the Church of Fand ( medieval ) , H.E.R.R .
( neoclassical ) and Scivias ( neofolk ) can all be grouped under the umbrella of 'martial industrial ' .
Martial industrial music frequently uses imagery related to war , totalitarian regimes , European nationalism , military displays , and political mass gatherings – contexts , in short , where the individual is subsumed by history and the mass will .
A range of philosophical , political , or religious themes with an illiberal , anti-cosmopolitan , and anti-egalitarian bias predominate , such as Friedrich Nietzsche 's Overman , Oswald Spengler 's pessimistic vision of Western decline , Mircea Eliade 's theories about sacred practice and symbolism , René Guénon 's writings on the `` spiritual degeneration '' of the West , Ernst Jünger 's ideas about the renewing power of war and adversity , Julius Evola 's reactionary apoliteia and mysticism , Nazi mysticism , and pre-Christian paganism .
Martial industrial is produced world-wide .
However , the scene is particularly strong in Germany , Hungary , France , Italy , Poland and Russia .
== Accusations of fascism == Some bands ( Von Thronstahl ) openly declare fascistic ideology , while others ( Kraschau ) favor monarchism or Falangism but some others ( Militia ) are eco-anarchists .
Some explore the erotic dimension of history and fascistic aesthetics ( Ordo Rosarius Equilibrio ) .
Occasionally martial industrial artists ( Skrol ) do not even touch historical/political issues .
Other bands that touch such issues and use politically incorrect imagery ( Turbund Sturmwerk ) refuse to disclose their real convictions .

Martial music or military music is a specific genre of music intended for use in military settings .
Much of the military music has been composed to announce military events as with bugle calls and fanfares , or accompany marching formations with drum cadences , or mark special occasions as by military bands .
However , music has been employed in battle for centuries , sometimes to intimidate the enemy and other times to encourage combatants , or to assist in organization and timing of actions in warfare .
Depending on the culture , a variety of percussion and musical instruments have been used , such as drums , fifes , bugles , trumpets or other horns , bagpipes , triangles , cymbals , as well as larger military bands or full orchestras .
Although some martial music has been composed in written form , other music has been developed or taught by ear , such as bugle calls or drum cadences , relying on group memory to coordinate the sounds .
== Types == === March music === The notion of march music began to be borrowed from the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century .
The Ottomans were believed to have introduced the first military bands in the thirteenth century , called mehter or Janissary bands .
The music is characterized by an often shrill sound combining bass drums , horns ( boru ) , bells , the triangle and cymbals ( zil ) and several other traditional instruments .
The sound associated with the mehterân exercised an influence on European classical music , with such composers as Joseph Haydn , Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , and Ludwig van Beethoven all writing compositions inspired by or designed to imitate the Ottoman music .
See also : American march music .
=== Marching songs === Marching songs , typically with patriotic and sometimes nostalgic lyrics , are often sung by soldiers as they march .
The songs invariably feature a rhythm timed to the cadence of the march .
There are many examples from the American Civil War , such as `` Marching Song of the First Arkansas '' and `` John Brown 's Body '' .
`` P'tit quinquin was popular during the Franco Prussian War of 1870 .
The Boer War generated numerous marching songs among which `` Marching to Pretoria '' is well known .
`` It 's a Long Way to Tipperary '' was a marching song of World War I that became a popular hit .
One of the most enduring marching songs from that war is probably the `` Colonel Bogey March '' , which was popular in World War II as `` Hitler Has Only Got One Ball '' ; the tune found later fame as part of the soundtrack for Bridge on the River Kwai .
The `` Dadao March '' was a patriotic song sung in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War .
`` White Army , Black Baron '' was written as a combat hymn for the Red Army of Russia in 1920 , while `` Erika '' was sung by the German army during World War II .
See also Songs of the Spanish Civil War .
=== Bugle calls === The bugle call is a short tune announcing scheduled and certain non-scheduled events on a military installation , battlefield , or ship .
These short music pieces are played from an instrument called the bugle , it has been used by militaries as means of communication..
This instrument can be heard from a far and in very noisy environments ( during battle ) .
It is a very effective way of giving orders and communicating .
Although no longer required by armies for communicating , these music pieces are still played for tradition and during ceremonies .
Well-known bugle calls include `` Taps '' , `` The Last Post '' , and `` Reveille '' .
See also : El Degüello .
=== Ruffles and flourishes === Ruffles and flourishes are fanfares for ceremonial music for distinguished people or groups .
Ruffles are typically played on drums , and flourishes are played on bugles .
Commissioned officers receive one ruffle and flourish , major generals get two , lieutenant generals three , and four-star generals and the President receive four .
They are commonly played in the United States .
=== Recorded music === The Vietnam war produced a hit song in 1966 , `` Ballad of the Green Berets '' which has a martial rhythm .
Curtis Mayfield 's 1963 hit `` Amen '' also features a marching rhythm , as does the US Top 40 hit , `` Burning Bridges '' by The Mike Curb Congregation ( 1971 ) .
In Vietnam and in particular in the Second Gulf War and in Afghanistan , recorded music ( often featuring rap music ) has been used by some soldiers as they travel , prepare for and engage in battle .
Performers such as Eminem have written songs with specific reference to the current wars including `` Bagpipes From Baghdad '' .
Also see : `` Soundtrack to War '' .
== Instruments == Historically , trumpets , drums , cymbals , bagpipes , and other loud musical instruments were used for clear communication in the noise and confusion of a battlefield .
They are easily carried while the instrumentalist is in motion , i.e. , marching .
Modern additions include the upright glockenspiel and several brass instruments including trombone and sousaphone , which are often used by military bands .
=== Drum === Chinese troops used tàigǔ drums to motivate troops , to help set a marching pace , and to call out orders or announcements .
For example , during a war between Qi and Lu in 684 BC , the effect of drum on soldier 's morale is employed to change the result of a major battle .
Fife-and-drum corps of Swiss mercenary foot soldiers also used drums .
They used an early version of the snare drum carried over the player 's right shoulder , suspended by a strap ( typically played with one hand using traditional grip ) .
It is to this instrument that the English word `` drum '' was first applied .
Similarly , during the English Civil War rope-tension drums would be carried by junior officers as a means to relay commands from senior officers over the noise of battle .
These were also hung over the shoulder of the drummer and typically played with two drum sticks .
Different regiments and companies would have distinctive and unique drum beats which only they would recognize .
See also Drum and bugle corps .
=== Trumpet === The earliest trumpets were signaling instruments used for military or religious purposes and the modern bugle continues this signaling tradition .
See also : Fanfare .
Officers in command gave orders via sound from the trumpet because it contained a piercing tone and high volume which meant it could be heard in the midst of combat .
Cavalry trumpets had a different timbre , so that their calls would not be mistaken for other sounds that were meant for to the infantry .
=== Bagpipe === An instrument that contains a piercing sound and graceful melody is meant to be played outdoors , its main goal is to inspired men and women in the midst of conflict .
It is also used in mourning the fallen and celebrating victory .
Used played in the build up to battle but not during .
Textual evidence for the use of Scottish bagpipes in battle dates from in 1396 , when records of the Battle of the North Inch of Perth reference `` warpipes '' being carried into battle , though it is believed that bagpipes were originally intended for peaceful music .
The Irish were also inspired by bagpipes , as witness in this 1586 account : `` This sort of instrument is held among the Irish to be a whetstone for martial courage : for just as other soldiers are stirred by the sound of trumpets , so they are hotly stimulated to battle by the noise of this affair .
Also see : Great Irish Warpipes .
=== Shawm === One of several woodwind instruments used in battle as earlier as the 12th century .
This instrument rose in popularity during the Renaissance period .
Believed to be a successor of the instrument , the zurna .
It was mostly used as a military instrument.The overpowering noise coming from this instrument was used as a psychological weapon.The shawm would eventually found its way to Europe during the Crusades See also Shawm == See also == Battle cry Martial industrial March music Military band War song Royal Artillery Band British Grenadiers March Henry George Farmer Kneller Hall == Further reading == Mark A.

`` Silu '' ( Devanagari : सिलु ) is a traditional Nepalese song about a couple from Kathmandu who go on a pilgrimage to Silu and get separated .
The ballad in Nepal Bhasa dates from the early 19th century .
Written by an unnamed composer , Silu is a popular seasonal song in Newar society .
It is one of the six seasonal songs and is sung during the rainy season ( August ) .
Silu is what the Newars call Gosaikunda , a holy lake located to the north of Kathmandu .
Situated at an elevation of 4,380 m in the Himalaya , it is associated with the Hindu deity Lord Shiva .
The lake is also held sacred by Buddhists who associate it with the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara .
== Synopsis == The epic song is in the form of a dialogue between the husband and wife .
When he announces his plan to visit Silu to take part in the ritual bathing festival , she expresses her desire to go with him .
He tries to dissuade her by reminding her of the saying that a husband and wife going together is bad luck .
But she insists , and he lets her come along .
When they reach Silu , the king sees her and sends soldiers to take her away and forcibly makes her his queen .
The depressed husband leaves home and becomes an ascetic .
One day , the queen asks the king to assemble all the ascetics on the palace grounds to give them alms .
The sadhus are gathered as per her wish , and when she spots her husband among them , she slips away with him disguised as a nun .
The couple are thus reunited .
== Pilgrimage == Silu Wanegu , the pilgrimage to Silu to take a holy dip in the lake , is a long-standing tradition in Newar society .
The trek is done in August , when a festival is held on the full moon day .
The pilgrimage has also been a subject of art since historical times .
Silu , a movie based on the ballad , was released in 1987 .
== Lyrics == The first few lines of the song appear below .

The Corps is a poetic hymn associated with the United States Military Academy .
It is second in importance to only the Academy 's Alma Mater .
The words were written by West Point Chaplain , Bishop H.S .
Shipman , around 1902 .
The accompanying music was composed in 1910 specially for the ceremonial closing of the Old Cadet Chapel and opening of the new Cadet Chapel .
The Corps was first sung on the steps of the Cadet Chapel on 12 June 1910 , and became part of the graduation ceremony starting in 1911 .
Today , The Corps is typically sung by the Cadet Glee Club ( West Point 's choir ) in companion to the Alma Mater at alumni gatherings , graduation , memorial ceremonies and funerals .
== Lyrics == The original words to The Corps , as written in 1902 are : === Gender specific lyrics controversy === In 2008 , the Superintendent of the United States Military Academy , LTG Franklin L. Hagenbeck ordered a change to the lyrics of The Corps and the Alma Mater .
The change was to remove gender-specific language in both century-old songs , which were both written at the turn of the 20th Century , when the Academy only admitted male cadets .
LTG Hagenbeck wrote a letter to the Association of Graduates explaining the reasoning for his decision .
Many graduates objected to this alteration of the original and hallowed lyrics of West Point songs , but to no avail .
A poll taken of former graduates resulted in a majority of objections , but the Superintendent proceeded to make the changes notwithstanding .
The changes to The Corps ' lyrics were thus : FROM : `` The men of the Corps long dead '' TO : `` The ranks of the Corps long dead '' FROM : `` We sons of today , we salute you '' TO : `` The Corps of today , we salute you '' FROM : `` You sons of an earlier day '' TO : The Corps of an earlier day '' FROM : `` And the last man feels to his marrow '' TO : `` And the last one feels to the marrow '' == References ==

The Marching and Cycling Band HHK was a marching band from Haarlem , The Netherlands and existed from 1964 until 2014 , started by a fusion in 1964 of two anchestor bands : Kunstkring Apollo and Harmonie Crescendo under the name of Haarlems Harmonie Kapel ( HHK ) .
The band had a unique way of performing : marching and cycling , hence the name : `` Marching and Cycling Band HHK '' .
The MaC-Band was a band that played music from the pop- , musical- and filmworld .
They exercised weekly .
== The band == On average the band hadbetween 20 and 25 performances a year , whereof the biggest part tookplace in the periods April - June and September - October .
Rather the most performances were cycling , but also marching performances are executed .
During the winter season there were a few performances and therefore the repertoire was ( partially ) updated .
Also , the music for the marching show of the new season was studied .
From 1995 until 2014 , in the beginning of the season a so-called training weekend for the whole association was organised , in addition to practicing for the show that season in a different way .
As of 2009 the band has its own YouTube-channel named MaCBandHHK where video 's of the performances and other activities were published .
== Performing on a bicycle == In 1973 a member of the board , Bram Visser , got the idea to , just like Dutch military bands had done years before , start performing with the marching band on bicycles .
The first performance of this nowadays well known band took place at the Grote Markt ( central market square ) during the March of Musicians of 1973 .
A yearly event that in those days took place in September in the evening .
The performance was done on own and borrowed bicycles .
After some hesitation by the rest of the board and due to the enormous success of the performance it was decided to buy 41 bicycles .
The bicycleplatoon existed for 41 years .
Through this way of making music the band gained fame in the Netherlands and abroad .
Since those days the band was requested for many sorts of performances , from serenades to carnavalparades and international musical festivals .
Often the band could be found in France , Belgium , Germany and The Netherlands .
